When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.

Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).

If performance is a concern, the If function could do a type assertion to see if s is a *unicode.RangeTable, and switch to an optimized implementation, the same way that the image/draw package does in the stdlib.

But I'm not sure if we even want a Ranges or If. The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes, then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk.

If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true.

By making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>, and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible.  That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.

We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method, after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo.

But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now, on the client side, from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too, obviously.

This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all? We could add it to main page (or may be just add a keyboard shortcut), in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name (with suggestion oracle for project, like it already does for branches).

I don't see the need for this change. If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin.

The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it.

The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit.

Even if you do want to split things out like this, it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the RO image based on a use flag.


Independent of whether splitting things up is a good idea, if Mike (who knows bash much better than I do, I think) likes the style of the new function you've made, it would be nice to incorporate the style changes back into the original function.",-1

The error handling is fine, but the message doesn't mention bootstage so it isn't clear where the failure is. I think you should fix that.

Then you set_bootstage_prop can be passed a node. In fact this function just has a call to fdt_setprop() so why have it at all? Just call fdt_setprop_cell or fdt_setprop_string instead, which are better suited to your requirements anyway

Re working_fdt, I do prefer a single reference to a global rather than multiple spread throughout the file, but if you remove the function then this is not an issue anyway, I think that the whole of this for() loop should be in a separate function called from bootstage_report() if working_fdt is not 0.

1091,"Patch Set 4:

Although already merged, I don't think this is the right solution. 

Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use ""checkLanguageAccess"" only if the TCA for the table has a ""languageField"".

""pages"" is not such a table, because there is ""pages_language_overlay"". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the ""Original Language"" is to remove the permissions for editing table ""pages"" and only allow ""pages_language_overlay"". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794

This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess.

Similar problem we have in the ""List view"", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more ""aggressive"" than in the GUI.

Correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has ""edit permissions"" on the ""pages"" table - just like TCEmain also does.

As this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on ""language restriction permissions on pages"" in the first place before fixing the GUI.

I am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but I am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5.

That's the difference between memcpy and memmove. If there was no overlap at all (which we could check for) then you could use memcpy, and that would make the normal case work like it always has.

The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want. 

When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same.

When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more!

When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c ""You, too, could be using RDTSCP!"". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though.

I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough.

So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag, commit message needs updating.",1

 HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();

 HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();

The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id, regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies, sort of like a makefile. Then, since it's idempotent, it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes, and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter.

Continuing on from the mandatory system fields, the below code will save the socialprofile data:

I think the setting of screen resolution is not important as it makes no different when I changed it to smaller or larger size therefore I chose the medium size (1024x768).

1964,"There does not appear to be a file called ""site-logo-white.png"" in the master HEAD. Rather, each theme defines its own logo under htdocs/theme/{themename}/static/images/site-logo.png . This file may be dark or light depending on the color of the theme.

Hm... the skins patch added the site-logo-small-white.png file to the ""raw"" theme for this specific purpose. BUT, depending on the theme used on the page, the corresponding site-logo-small.png will not necessarily have dark text. On a dark-background theme, site-logo-small.png and site-logo.png will themselves have light text.

Unfortunately, it looks like what we need is a total of six files:

1. site-logo.png: Used in normal page headers

2. site-logo-light.png: Used on skinned Pages with ""light text logo""

3. site-logo-dark.png: Used on skinned Pages with ""dark text logo""

4. site-logo-small.png: Used in microheaders pages

5. site-logo-small-light.png: skinned, light text, micro-header pages

The admin can always edit the template view to suit their needs if the page already exists for some reason.
