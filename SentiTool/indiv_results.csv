1	1	GSM isn't in the original list which is why it isn't in the enum.
1	2	Yeah, we can file a bug against android or just fix it and submit a patch.
3	2	when i was suggesting flipping the boolean, i did also wonder whether we wouldn't be better off just passing in the length. if it's <= 0, interpret that as ""don't know""? that would then move 8192 down out of the callers too.

or... i really like the way you went for readFully rather than implementing the missing read()s, which is what i'd actually imagined. how about we go one further and just have a static fromFile or similar? then it could do the stat, and have everything it needs. you could even use Libcore.os open/fstat/read/close to avoid the RandomAccessFile without increasing the overall amount of code.
3	1	Ohhh. I have a white background, so I didn't catch the yellow highlight. Thanks!
1	1	The code in this library was generated by emugen and then manually modified ('vi' transformations) to match this library need. This code will be replaced with driver implementation.
2	1	Per our discussion, make this a class that's just the combobox? Maybe like AndroidApiCombo?
2	1	Don't introduce new types unless you truly need them; they are supposed to be equivalence classes, and the more you define, the larger the policy will grow (GS4 policy has significant bloat due to unnecessary types that get _exactly_ the same allow rules as existing types).
1	1	similar to previous diff; this is just moving the crop state from an SWT Button state to a flag in the wizard state object
2	1	if we've got this, do we still need the flag?

this field should probably be called something more like ""allocated_stack_size"".
2	2	I think the cleanest style here would be to make this:
class_linker->IsCompiledImageMethod(m)
and then embed MayBe... into ClassLinker as IsCompiledImageMethod. It'd be nice to avoid exposing the debugger to inner notions of oat files.
1	1	Just a question: Does ant use ; as a path separator on all platforms, or should you use File.pathSeparator (which will be : on Windows) ?
1	1	I wonder why jetbrains repeats this code in all their bundles.
1	2	Point-of-fact: it was the wait feature that you now find workable from Python... The '--nowait' argument disables that new feature, reverting back to prior behavior.
2	1	Either you don't need these brackets, or you need brackets above where you do:

if(icmp->type != ICMP_ECHO && icmp->type != ICMP_ECHOREPLY) {

Can you make the two consistent?
2	1	Added tests for other resource type.

I feel there should be a test that ensure the issue in the bug is resolved.  It also verifies that the generated.xml can at least run through aapt.

Well, your version is more easy to understand. I'll replace comment in ammended commit.
2	2	Also explain in this file why the compiler was failing, and dx's smart/dumb behavior.
1	2	We tried to avoid include the large block in #if ... #else... #endif. :).

And does this change break MIPS? Our change will not impact MIPS.
1	1	This class should be for launch specific utilities, but I agree with you, it makes sense to consolidate until it becomes unwieldy.
2	2	Actually this is tricky to use an enum because this is going to be mostly dynamic based on the content of the images folder.
1	2	i think you really want a pthread_once_t here instead, unless i'm misunderstanding what you're trying to do.
2	2	who uses this method ? I don't see why this is useful. I'd just get rid of this method and the associated field.

Once you do that, you can just collapse this class into a single static method (runAll) and get rid of the Pair class.
2	1	Thanks Ian, I was not aware of this. Created b/15574371.
2	1	I prefer the increased type safety of enum classes.
1	2	I disabled these with 
pass_manager_options->SetDisablePassList(""GVN,DCE"") in jit_compiler.cc, there wasn't an option for kLocalValueNumbering.
1	1	In which case, shouldn't the code just say that all other open projects should already have their SDK's pointing to the SDK used by the IDE?

i.e., now that we do this, we shouldn't have to modify other projects, only this project since all others should already be in sync.

The fishy part here is just that choosing something in a project import dialog affects other projects which doesn't make sense. If you want that experience, then the dialog should be more of a global IDE preference.
2	2	Yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it's really subtle, so it'd be nice to have a better description of the problem, it's not really Python specific as you mention, i.e. something like:

""""""
Some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling CreateProcess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.

When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.

Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).
""""""

The PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST isn't directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because I don't think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code). It's probably better to avoid mentioning it, or add a note like ""ideally, use PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST if running on Vista or higher""
1	2	> Can we have 32-bit processes calling into a 64-bit BufferQueue or vice-versa?

The 32-bit process would be calling in to a different BufferQueue, right?
2	1	Please document these. is_precise is we know the exact type? Would 'exact' be clearer?
2	1	Not related, but may be better to move to constructPorperty(String suffix) or something like that.
1	2	Let's avoid having commented out code.  Delete the DCHECK (which looks wrong to me anyway - you certainly could have a const index, but backends are under no obligation to take advantage of that information.
1	1	we have audio_data_file and so this can be changed to that.
1	1	We don't need this line any more. Or we could keep this here and use it instead of calling parseInt in the five instances below.
1	1	call the function, pass the device also into the function
1	2	Anything that needs to run in the UI thread needs to be wrapped this way, otherwise the IDE complains. It is in the UI testing doc I sent you: https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1UBVjIEYXoNVZeYT1NKjqPhCYSkU-X2lWVCrFHbXnPnM/edit?usp=sharing
1	1	i don't think this is ever defined on Android. it's a BSD thing.
1	2	Maybe pick a different name to avoid a collision with the field of the same name in Main?
1	1	Could you factor the whole function out into reboot_service_impl so we don't need to gotos?
3	1	a table of function pointers sounds good right about now...
2	2	You're right. The issue is that the onSampleSelected() callback uses the Combo index to fetch the sample from mSamplePath, so the way you have it they don't match (if you try, selecting a sample will load a different one). The trivial solution is to sort mSamplePaths alphabetically like it should have been done in the first place anyway (my fault for forgetting that).
1	1	Changed from heap to stack based allocation, will now only allocate enough to hold idmap header.
2	2	performTransaltion has different purpose. If scale is less than equal to 1 we will not perform transaltion. 
If the device doesn't support multi touch we need not go into this block and skip the execution of the next six lines, hence it was added here.
2	1	Please use double quotes for EGL/egldefs.h and log/log.h. These headers are now local. Same comment for other files including them.
3	1	OH, I forgot your that CL :-)
However STLPORT_WHITELIST isn't defined yet at this point.
In config.mk it loads envsetup.mk (which eventually loads the product makefiles) before it defines STLPORT_WHITELIST.
On the other hand, we can remove libstlport from this file, and add it to specific device's makefile, such as device/asus/flo/device-common.mk. I'd really like to keep the device names out of the build project.
1	1	maybe this runnable needs to run after the previous one's onSuccess?
1	3	We would prefer to keep this.  It is possible for the RILD and radio code to pass the sequence number through into radio state as the request is being acted on - the RILD may notice the socket error and re-establish the connection and then the response comes back from the radio with the old sequence number and get's passed back through the newly-connected RILD.

Just because your implementation may not do this, we can imagine other OEMs passing back obsolete responses that would match a newly-zero'd RIL sequence number and confuse things.

Couldn't you just remember the first sequence number your RILD connection received?  Then you know the number of requests you've received.
3	4	My only worry here is that future c or assembly versions of memcmp16 might use x14, x15. I have used a more conservative approach in my tree:


1852 .Ldo_memcmp16:
1853     /* save lr, and return value if comparison equal */
1854     stp x0, x30, [sp, #-16]!
1855 
1856     /* set-up args for __memcmp16 */
1857     mov x0, x2
1858     uxtw x2, w3
1859 
1860     bl __memcmp16
1861 
1862     /* restore lr, and return value if comparison equal */
1863     ldp x1, x30, [sp], #16
1864 
1865     /* if the strings are equal (i.e. x0 == 0) then return length comparison */
1866     cmp x0, #0
1867     csel x0, x1, x0, eq
1868 
1869     ret
1870 END art_quick_string_compareto
1	2	Actually, I realized late last night that it probably didn't make sense to specify the damage using frects, since the damage is defined on pixel boundaries (I was originally thinking frect because sourceCrop is a frect, but that's not exactly analagous).

I think this should be hwc_rect_t. That probably implies that we should use hwc_region_t, except that size_t is way overkill and will eat another 8 bytes in 64-bit relative to this (since we're currently getting the uint32_t for free because of padding).
1	2	That's just the thing; I don't have a bug report. Somebody complained on Google+ that setting this attribute has the undesirable side effect of killing onClick attributes; when I asked Roman if he knew anything about this (we had discussed textIsSelectable before, in the context of adding them to the default templates) he mentioned he had also seen some weirdness around these, but didn't have details.

I should dig deeper, but since I'm swamped with some other work I figured it was better to just disable this check until I know more. (It's actively suggesting users set an attribute that apparently isn't always the right thing.)
1	1	It seems to me to be the case. There is a bug:
https://b.corp.google.com/issues/17586779
shertz probably knows more about it.
1	2	No. The exception is needed so it is rethrown if the user decides to cancel. User can only see exception stack trace in the log.
1	1	If this is considered a development tool and not a production tool, it should have LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS := eng
2	1	Please place functions in <code></code> tags throughout.
1	1	I don't understand why you need the boolean. This should be new_rti.SetTop(); new_rti.SetInexact().
1	1	maybe update this comment to give an example of the unparseable credentials.
2	2	This depends on how we define the ABI. For function prototype like ""void foo(float a, double b, float c);"".

Now the argument registers would be ""a(s0), b(s2/s3=d1), c(s1)"".

We could remove this unless we define ABI to use argument registers like ""a(s0), b(s2/s3=d1), c(s4)""
1	1	These calls don't do the same thing.  As a result, lockNow() must be called unconditionally.
1	2	Damn it, that wasn't supposed to be there. I'll remove it.
1	1	If we converted helper code to Groovy, we would have the Elvis operator. And closures to handle the try+finally+close idiom. Just sayin' ;)
1	1	I think he's looking for the exact string ""h"", the 2 is to count the terminating 0 at the end.
1	1	Element. This one stuck out. I think the only ones to try to capitalize are ""Allocation, Type, Element"", since that trio is the dominant set of APIs for interacting with any sort of data from Java.
2	1	How about making MapAnonymous return null so that we only need the single check that table_mem_map_.get() != nullptr.
1	1	If this need to be public, can we have a short doc comment?
2	2	That's not what I was saying. Just like
public static float getMdpiScaleFactor(Density density) {
 if (density == Density.ANYDPI) {
   density = Density.XXHIGH.getDpiValue();
 }
 return density.getDpiValue() / (float) Density.MEDIUM.getDpiValue();
}

But whatever, it's not a big deal.
2	1	What's the correct thing for things exec'd from init?

I assume we can use logwrapper if we need to.
2	1	Currently the array is always allocated with new if own_arrays_ is true. Also delete nullptr is defined to be a NOP.
2	1	we might want to support Z here, since that's coming in a day or two
1	2	That is great - it also means you can move that line outside of the if/else.

You also need another in6_addr: you have to have both dest and gateway (though for default and host you only use one or the other).  Same is needed in the v4 case.
1	1	Just curious, how come you use a RandomAccessFile here? It might be simpler to just Guava (which lint already depends on):
String firstLine = Files.readFirstLine(file, Charsets.US_ASCII);
(that's com.google.common.io.Files)
1	1	Templatizing this would make the change smaller, as you don't need to make it a member function.
1	1	Agree displayable is not ideal. Looking for something that means ""not internal"". How about getNonInternalFieldModifiers()?

Given they're hidden APIs / internal comments I suggest not wasting any time on this: my point is the comment is not as clear to me as I think it could be.

Feel free to act on the suggestion or ignore. The later draft is clearer.
2	1	How about:
while (next != null && next->asPhi()->GetRegNumber() == reg_number) {
  if (next->GetType() == GetType()) return next;
  next = next->GetNext();
}
return nullptr;
3	1	No, but its impact is pretty minimal so I wouldn't worry about it.
2	3	i think we're better off just taking the auto-generated stub like we did in the original patch. it doesn't hurt anyone that there's dead code at the end because the syscall never returns, and it's arguably more confusing to be insisting on supplying our own stub.
1	1	This doesn't do any correctness tests of the file, while a start that they exist, I could just be touch'ing files.
1	2	We can go back and change this to the char* version if it gets too difficult to figure out what's going on.
1	1	If you are currently on 0.10,+ you won't see the message. This only appears only when coming from 0.8 or earlier.
2	1	why? we removed prelinking for a very specific reason (security), and I don't think we want to put it back in the platform.
2	2	s/exit/continue/

Exiting the loop doesn't do a final update of v. The write to conflict with this read must happen during the setup for a subsequent iteration. 

This one does bother me. To be clear, what's going on is:

v = a[0]
go func() { x = v }()
v = a[1]
go func() { y = v }()

There is no race involving the second goroutine, since its read is guaranteed to happen after the write of v = a[1]. The race is between the x = v and the v = a[1]. I don't understand why the race detector does not detect that misordering 100% of the time. I filed #10589 about this. At least this fixes the build so that we can detect future breakages while Dmitriy thinks about this one.
2	2	since the spec says that the same format should be used for both critical options and extensions, I named the structures:
optionsTuple, optionsTupleValue, and optionsTupleEmptyValue (I believe I needed the latter to marshal extensions with empty values where there is no double length prefix) - starting at Line 89 of certs.go.   I used them in the marshalTuples and parseTuples.  Regarding unmarshaling - please take a look at the current version, I wanted to use the same function for critical options and extensions, and to handle properly empty and non-empty values I believe some ""low-level"" handling is needed.  I used an instance of optionsTupleValue structure to pass to Unmarshal (Line 186).
1	1	s/Test/test/

keep all lowercase (or make it a real sentence and end in period).
1	1	Yeah, I used that in other places. You're right it doesn't make much of a difference: no difference for norm and about 20% or 20k for the language tables.
I've simplified the code and also now use NewFormattedFileWriter in all the other places where I'm used go/format before. See the diff of language/table.go to see how it is affected (will first do the IANA update separately).

Unfortunately, this increases the diff a lot. Again in language/tables.go. But you can verify the data itself didn't change by looking at the checksum at the bottom.
1	2	Omit the err at the end.  Its the result of the last possible test making it probably meaningless and possibly misleading.
1	2	Sorry, wasn't paying enough attention to the context (clearly the param is moved to the heap) and instead assumed that if esc was not EscHeap, that therefore it was not ""heap"".
1	1	s/importsSet/pkgSet/

should explain that this set is only needed so we can create an duplicate free pkgList
1	2	Isn't the Config callback sufficient? It sounds tricky that a returned Config is valid only until the Config callback is called. If possible I prefer limiting the Config's life inside the Config callback and letting users maintain a copy of some info based on need.
2	1	the previous event may not be traceEvGoCreate, like this scenario:
when trace start goroute is in syscall and then exitsyscall and finally goStart.
For this case, we can't access the stack information because the previous event is traceEvGoSysExit which doesn't contain the stack.
I just think out a solution:
when we receive a traceEvGoSysExit, we reserve the gocreate event by link it and access it here. But I don't know if there are any other cases or any side effect, any idea?
1	1	Yep, I've merged the two into |supportedSignatureAlgorithms|.
2	2	You can open as many issue tickets as you like. But we would still have to add all these tests in here, and find solution that fit them. Why delay?
3	1	> The flag package is ideally only imported in main.

Where did this notion of ""ideal"" come from?  The advice I usually hear (and give) is: don't register flags except from the main package, because you're mutating a global variable.

This utility function doesn't touch any global variables.  Isn't its purpose pretty obvious from the usage example above?
1	1	I think the bytes.Buffer version was more readable.
2	2	This || breaks -e. If you need this information you need to reimplement -e yourself.

if ! go build -a std; then
    failed=true
    if $sete; then
        exit 1
    fi
fi
2	2	Is this the right API? An alternative is:

func If(s RuneSet, tTrue, tFalse Transformer) Transformer

type RuneSet interface {
  Contains(rune) bool
}

and have unicode.RangeTable implement this interface.

If performance is a concern, the If function could do a type assertion to see if s is a *unicode.RangeTable, and switch to an optimized implementation, the same way that the image/draw package does in the stdlib.

But I'm not sure if we even want a Ranges or If. The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes, then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk. Instead, I'd just loop over the input and append to a []byte. It's not like you have some input that contains both Code Page 437 and Shift-JIS and you want to switch between them. Your phone number Ranges example seems a bit contrived, and again, I'd just for/range over the string for that particular task. As for title-casing latin but not greek, is that something that people really want to do??

I wonder what Rob thinks. Can you start a separate e-mail thread just for API design?
1	1	In code this will read ""mgr.Mgr"". If move to svc package, it would read ""svc.Mgr"". Also, Let's just name in Manager so: ""svc.Manager"".
1	1	Because total bytes of addrs should be greater than size.
2	1	How about to change above line like below?

trun(t, gt.client, ""git"", ""checkout"", ""-b"", ""newbranch"", ""origin/master"")
2	1	Since you are rewriting the entire file anyway, please try to put callers before callees, in general, so that reading the file top to bottom you usually know what a function is for when you see it. So:

gen
casebody
caseClauses
genCases
2	3	> Ugh, really?

That's how I read http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/nss-mdns/ at least.

 > So do we need an mdns.allow parser too?

Even nss-mdns discourages using the file (""Please note that usually mDNS is not used for anything but .local, hence you usually don't want to touch this file."") so you can probably just fall back to cgo if you detect its existence.
1	2	debug print but not errant, and commented out. i got tired of putting back every time i came to this routine.
2	1	It'd be nice to coalesce such case lists into a single line, up to some line length.
1	2	s/data/key/

This variable name (in docs) is more important than conflicting with internal variable names.

""data"" isn't much more descriptive than ""variable"", ""thing"" or ""stuff"".
2	1	This condition is always true. I assume the condition you meant was n != ptrSize. Though I see you removed this condition altogether in CL 9704 (rebase failure?).
2	2	This is problematic, because you know you have Go code passing a Go pointer into C.  Maybe you had that before and I didn't notice.  I don't think we should put code like that in our examples.
1	1	No need for indirection here.
Merge benchmarkTCPConcurrentReadWrite into this function, and use the addr ""127.0.0.1:0"" directly.
1	1	And here, end with a single ""},"", and the next line becomes ""}},"".
1	2	frame := getcallersp(unsafe.Pointer(&siz))
Delete next three lines.

Also, given that now it's just the callersp, s/frame/sp/ everywhere, including in the defer struct field name.
1	1	I can't parse the part between this comma and the next one.
1	1	can you combine the declaration of ctstr above with this assignment ?
1	2	Fair enough. But still deleting registry entries is wrong - you won't be able to run that program again without them. You can disable service from inside your program too http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/winsvc/mgr.
1	2	Consider merging these uncommon write barrier forms in to one function that takes flags.  I think there's a bug in the later atomic function fixes that this would help address.
2	1	we need to test both non-privileged ""udp4"" and privileged ""ip4"" sockets here.
2	2	I've shortened to isIPv4, but I don't think preferIPv4 is correct.  first(preferIPv4) seems reasonable, but partition(preferIPv4) doesn't actually prefer IPv4.
1	2	I think that's just a mistake in make.bash.  It's better to fail fast and minimize distractions to stderr when you know you've already lost.

I'd say add an exit failure here and then submit. If you feel strongly about keeping it as-is, you can submit this too and we can fix them both later if we decide to.
2	1	If non-empty, go into reverse mode where the buildlet dials the coordinator instead of listening for connections. The value is a comma-separated list of modes, e.g. ....
3	2	Good point, I missed that.  Determinism is a key feature.  Fixed.
1	1	Note that this means envp is empty, while you fill in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, and TMPDIR in the gomobile code.  I'm not sure how to get the environment or if it's even necessary. (All the Go environment functions in runtime assume that Go has already been somewhat initialized.)
1	1	s/start/e/ would be consistent with the methods above.
1	1	$(dirname $0)

would mean you don't break if someone runs this from another dir.
1	1	// _g_.m is reachable via allgs, so WB can be eliminated.
1	2	""Types"" is an overloaded term in programming. Is it an actual term in the source documents, or can we use a different term here? Is ""type"" the same as ""MIB""??
2	2	Copied from sys_openbsd_386s.s and missed - fixed :)
2	1	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366058(v=vs.85).aspx#IfType

It's possible to check by IF_TYPE_SOFTWARE_LOOPBACK. But I don't know what the expected returns of Interfaces().

Mikio, could you please describe to me the spec of Interfaces/InterfaceAddrs?
2	1	I was mentioning the blank line. Please don't remove tk.WithExtra.
1	1	it doesn't leave them; it always removes them.
""use specified directory for temporary files""
2	4	It adds more things to go wrong than just downloading everything again to do a reinstall. I understand the desire, downloads are a pain, but downloading again is a much more predictable zero state than some set of possibly-correct archives on local disk checked against some possibly-correct set of hashes.

All of which is a lot of extra moving parts to work around a problem (slow connections). Is it worth it? Maybe. But it is a lot more to go wrong.
1	1	Same comment as above

  for shift := 0; shift < 8; shift += nibBitsWidth
1	2	I considered using ioutil.TempDir but had similar concerns as Minux. It is unclear to me whether any state in PPROF_TMPDIR is expected to persist between calls to pprof.

Also, since there isn't a single test covering the pprof internal libraries, I opted for the smallest possible change.

From cmd/pprof/README I get the impression that the code is frozen to a certain extent, so I didn't want to change too much either.
1	1	put a comment before this test, explaining what it's trying to test?
3	1	Done (gerrit tells me off if the commit subject is too long:

(W) 873ed2c: commit subject >65 characters; use shorter first paragraph

but does the go project really care?)
1	1	FWIW:

After the first Mod, a >= 0. b is already > 0 by definition. So the rest of this code is all done using natural numbers and thus could probably be (slightly) more efficient by using nat's directly. Perhaps next CL.
1	1	I agree this can be discovered without the text. Deleted the comment. Same in OpenKey.
2	3	I'm not sure I understand your point here. Do you mean I should talk about things like field alignment and so on?

I think that mentioning Java would make this more confusing.
1	2	This should probably be moved above the goos==""openbsd"" check so that unknown options on OpenBSD also force cgo lookups.
1	2	Ah, the perils of copy-paste. Updated to ""ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384"".
2	1	http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/benchcmp will help make the benchmark comparison more readable.
1	1	// use Russian Peasant algorithm, adapted for exponentiation
1	1	{""abbrev"", ""info"", ""line"", ""str""}
would be consistent with the dwarf.New arg order.

Ditto in pe/file.go.
2	1	""easy"" is marketing; let the code speak for itself. :)
2	1	I feel like these explanatory comments belong in the code, not just the code review.
2	1	I now believe that all paths have already done a finishsweep by this point so removing this as you did is correct.
2	1	Because it's racy. It should be guarded optimally with a lock that is not so global, but then you're talking about improvements that are in the nanosec granularity.
1	2	I wouldn't bother with bufio.NewReader, just read 100 bytes or something rather than bothering with ReadString.
1	1	s/logical//

(logical as opposed to what? it's all logical in software... - leave away)

how about:

Loading is controlled by this dependency graph.
1	2	This will always be nil, right? As above, I think you can remove this argument.
1	1	Should this just be
func Run() { etc }
and have callers explicitly call Register beforehand?
1	1	this doesn't make sense to me.

Why can we distinguish it? What depends on what happening before what?
2	2	It's in the debug code below, but I'd add a comment here saying something like

    // n = (p - base) / s.elemsize, using division by modular multiplication
2	1	Please put code snippets into double back ticks in order to highlight them in the changelog (``computeChangeSets()``, ``persistAll()``, ``hasUnpersistedChanges()``)
2	2	I suggest to add a wrapper class like F3FLOW3PersistenceObjectStorage and keep the API attach() and detach() stable.
1	1	You can simply use here $GLOBALS['TYPO3_LOADED_EXT']
It is initialized in the bootstrap. Basically this global does not need initialization. And extension could still use it in ext_tables and ext_localconf.
1	1	Same question on side-effects as on the previous file
2	1	no hsc in exceptions please. the exception handler does take care of proper encoding
2	1	ERROR: TRUE, FALSE and NULL must be uppercase; expected ""FALSE"" but found ""false""
3	1	it would be nice to use a DTO for the options. this would make it possible to extend it later (which I am pretty sure we will do) without breaking extensions using the interface
1	1	are you sure about this loop, which does not run ;-)
1	1	Use existing $GLOBALS['LANG']->sL('LLL:EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml:show_item.php.uid') 
with ""Uid:"" ?
1	1	valign is still spread a lot across the core - this will be a seperate task to clean this up. this makes it only more easy to find.
2	2	Stefan, I'm just mostly replicating the what is done when including CSS styled content's TS using the include static select. To me your questions show you did not look at the issue. Can we please get this through?

Apart from the above, no there is not a filename, and yes there needs to be a slash.
1	1	Enable the deprecation log here is not finally discussed. I'm 60/40 for not logging, because the deprecation log will get extremely flooded. When enabling, only the first setting (and not all three) should be logged to minimize the flood. The logging could be enabled in the next version, and till then it should be documented very well.
1	1	Is the model about logs (as the class name suggests) or about log rows (as the parameter name suggests)? At least one of them needs to be changed.
1	1	add a whitespace before/after = when assigning $row
1	1	functional changes?? I just flipped the ifs. But I just see that there's still the skipSystemDependencyCheck stuff in it.
2	4	I actually fear that PHP accepts this due to some easteregg or so :)
2	2	why do we json_encode() $scopeData here? We do not do this in the base class. Furthermore it is already serialized.

The only difference in this method compared to the one in the base class is now the Tree.thisScript stuff. The question therefore is: Is this a bug in the baseclass that Tree.thisScript is not set, or is it superfluous here?
If neither applies, then still the question remains, if there's a nicer way of adding this code snippet without overriding (and copyiing) the complete method from the base class?
1	1	add a space after CMS so it read TYPO3 CMS 7
same for CMS8
1	1	Me neither, i am just writing functional tests for this ... gimme a sec.
1	1	The new/better URL would be http://tracker.phpbb.com/browse/PHPBB3-3832
2	1	did you want to save the three characters ""urn""? not worth it IMO ;)
1	1	+1
Also this method shows a lot of errors/hints in the code inspector (unused variables etc.) but I find it hard to refactor this atm
2	1	I'd say yes. I mean, why not have hex for your file sizes internally? :)
1	1	should we mention the full classname here?
TYPO3FlowPersistenceDoctrineService
1	1	divider/spacer not needed any more - spaces should be created by t3skin itself
1	2	Since BE was IE10 (as of the member var above) I think changing the member to edge is not a problem, but I would keep the IE8 default here, which does not hurt us, and will also not hurt third party stuff then.
1	1	Maybe some info about the purpose (selecting node position?)
1	1	I think we use spaces instead of tabs after variable name (all  @foo above).
1	1	Suggestion:

Your account or email address does not exist.
2	1	I wouldn't recommend to use a percentage here.. With ""This change is backwards-compatible most of the time"" or ""This does not change the public API..."" we should be on the safe side
2	1	actually I don't know why it is like this in the login but not in the logout.. I would assume it should be the same in both places, and that this one is the more robust one..
1	1	you can remove the access tag and set the function actually to private
2	2	It is a core class, why should it be independent from core usage?

""If you just assign an end date you have to jump in the source code to become an idea how the start date is resolved.""

This can be written into the function comment, so if we may change $GLOBALS['EXEC_TIME'] we do not need to change so much calls.
1	1	I checked other __construct comments and there where no such annotation.
1	1	For readability I prefer an inverted condition as guard clause.
3	2	Good catch, my bad (it differs in master, see Iadfa1fb78e101e67ed47a6f3b5ea88ff12c90ca6)
1	1	Do we any chance to detect whether the call was made from outside the TYPO3 Namespace? Otherwise we'll get lots of deprecations if we call a public method from another class in Core, which is public but not part of the API.
1	1	It appears the requisite form is ""elseif,"" so I left this one as-is.  

""...TYPO3 code must not use the else if construct.""(http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CodingGuidelinesReference/PhpFileFormatting/PhpSyntaxFormatting/Index.html)
1	1	The doc comments are inheritted from the parent class(es)
1	1	I would prefer the previous formatting of line breaks.
1	1	Why not use:

if ($limit > 0) {

} elseif ($limit < 0) {

}
1	1	here as well: if ($value === NULL || strpos()...) { continue; }
1	1	Whitespace matters. We use tabs, and trailing whitespace has to be removed.
1	1	If no version can be parsed ""0.0.0"" Ã¢â¬â ""0.0.0"" is the result
3	1	We have that around many classes this way now. If I recall correctly we have not guideline for this. Would you be fine with keeping it this way? If so, please merge.
1	1	space before ( missing. Causes reoccurring changes proposed by database analyzer in Installer
2	1	what is the reason for having them private?

I mean I usually like private stuff, but it's uncommon in TYPO3 CMS ;-)
1	1	I don't line inline styles, can this be done in CSS?
1	1	The phpdoc states that an array is returned. Would it be better to return an array() instead of NULL?
1	2	what about Jigal's comment ""Copying an array for the sake of a variable name is a waste of resources IMO."" ?
3	1	It is a logical change, but it is correct!

$configuration['vendorName'] !== NULL

triggers a PHP notice, when $configuration['vendorName'] is not set
2	4	Ai, we missed a use-case here. I'm affraid that I know why this wasn't implemented yet. This doesn't check if the files inside the deleted folder have active references like is done above. See also https://review.typo3.org/#/c/33562/
1	2	already defined here: BasicFileUtility::$tempFN

there is a @todo for this attribute to change it to ""visible"". as static?
1	1	This could impact the development context when doing a partial compilation, is it noticable?

We should re-use the filename (micro-op).
2	1	Please use $GLOBALS['TBE_TEMPLATE'] here, so the code is more consistent
1	2	WARNING: Code after RETURN statement cannot be executed
1	2	I don't care about the number of instances of ReferenceIndex. I want to have this cache inside BackendUtility::explodeSoftRefParserList() which is static.
1	2	alternatively trigger_error() can be used instead of the HtmlMessageHandler.. Basically it's a problem with PHP, read more here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2429642/why-its-impossible-to-throw-exception-from-tostring
1	2	I think, we should replace this by getBySeverity() to avoid juggling with message types in userland
2	1	Could be

if (!isset($colPos) || $cRow['colPos'] !== $colPos) {

since colPos is set using $cRow['colPos'], thus the type must be the same.

Just have to remove $colPos = '' a few lines before.
2	1	Comment should have a space and uppercase the first letter like in the other comments.
1	1	I removed this in patch set 2 - my use case should be handled in the (abstract) controller
2	1	This check is improved in https://review.typo3.org/#/c/32645/1
1	1	... the right path in *TYPO3:*FLOW3:package:git:gitBinary
4	1	oh, good catch! funny this slipped in ... btw: ArrayUtility from extbase should be reviewed and at first glance it seems most of it could be merged to core ArrayUtility.
2	2	don't remove this comment here! the require once is obsolete only
1	1	There is no need to reference $wizard, it's an object
1	2	[BUGFIX] sql_fetch_assoc() and sql_fetch_row() should default to FALSE

Initialize default output to FALSE for sql_fetch_assoc() and sql_fetch_row().
1	1	Could you add another test which uses line breaks after ""${"" and before ""}""?
1	2	This code is broken.

$this->storage needs to be changed
1	3	@param is missing

In addition, I'd prefer to have a setter (or only getter that can be mocked) for this constant. This would be cleaner than having this as a method parameter.
1	1	I guess it's because hasRole only returns boolean, and the array key is needed as well..
2	2	I agree with Markus - if only for code-consistency purposes, add the =array() - it is bad karma anyway to have arguments with default values preceding ones without a default value.
1	1	perform this check before fetching the translations above? in the else-branch you then set $allOptions to array(); Maybe initialise it to an empty array as the first line of this function (as in functions before) and only fetch translations when needed here
1	1	prefer to have variables as local as possible.  This helps with long-term maintenance.

for ( unsigned int i=0; ....
{
   for ( unsigned int j=0; ...
{
}
}
2	2	This needs to have been initialized to the correct size here.

JacobianType jacobian( dim, 
                           transform->NumberParameters())
1	1	The ""git commit"" line needs a continuation character to include the following '-m' line.  However, you should be able to fold the entire commit message into one quoted string starting on the above line.  Be sure to leave the second line blank.
1	1	Just 'Iterator' would be more consistent, and is not ambiguous.
1	1	Only the find_package call actually needs to be in the itk-module-init.cmake file to make the imported targets visible globally.  Everything else should be able to go inside the module CMakeLists.txt file.
1	1	Why not level 1?  We don't care about warnings in third-party code.

Using level 3 could actually *increase* the level depending on the actual build flags.
2	1	it should be 

  if( this->m_UsePhysicalSpace && !this->m_PhysicalSpacesMatch )
1	1	Mind putting text documenting what's happening here? We shuould start documenting non-obvious stuff
1	1	this->

typedef ""char"" named concept.

hard coded ""0""
1	2	""Add test(s) performing the static code analysis using CppCheck""
2	4	The usage of exception specification here is very bad! If any only exception is thrown, then the program will terminate. Imagine what will happen if that occurred in Slicer! Have you verified that not a single method usage can throw an exception of a different kind?
1	2	Probably want to make this 
if (this->InputTimeValues.size()<=1  && this->DisableResetCache == 0)
1	2	Why not move this up into the anonymous namespace above? It is harder to read going from RWMolecule constructor/destructor to internal class and back again. Maybe I missed something subtle? If so, maybe we could add a brief comment.
1	1	Why are you using cerr here instead of vtkErrorMacro?
1	2	I have reused some cmake code I had... It should be some left over from the copy-paste :/
1	1	There's already bunch of strcpy calls scattered throughout this file anyways.
1	1	This should probably be ignore.  It is not part of the explicit ITK style specification.
1	1	Ho yes, perhaps I should change the commit message ?

It's because the policy was set to NEW, so it will do nothing anyway, as we are already using cmake > 2.6.0
1	2	The Slerp I was thinking of, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp doesn't seem to be in all caps - is this something else? It does say somewhere to avoid acronyms but there are exceptions (this may be one of them).
1	1	ThreadIdType numberOfThreads = this->GetNumberOfThreadsUsed();
1	1	bodies of ""if""s must be inside brackets, even if it is only one line.
1	1	PointContainer * points = this->m_Mesh->GetPoints();
1	1	Why call it GetStartIndices() instead of the expected ""GetSeeds()"" ?
1	1	The language style needs to be instructive rather than conversational here.  This is primarily intended for the software guide.

Remove the ""Therefore"" and ""For instance"" and make the sentences more authoritative.
2	1	Same here, toQt or just toVariant as it is taking a Json::Value.
1	1	Since this script will go in ITK's tree and not the hooks, it should be licensed as the rest of ITK (which will soon be Apache but is not yet AFAIK).  Besides, the rest of the Apache license infrastructure (LICENSE and NOTICE) is not present yet.  Also, we should assign the copyright to the Insight Software Consortium for code going in ITK proper.
1	1	Should we just take this if out?  It doesn't actually have a body.
1	1	reconsider why is that these variables should be ""protected"" instead of ""private""
1	1	Check if the number of neighbors integer type can be obtained as a trait from the KdTree class.

Move body to .hxx

use  this->m_NumberOfNeighbors
1	1	This should only be added if the RGBZ view plugin is going to be built. Maybe the proper place to add this test is in that plugin.
3	1	I did not make comments on all of these before because it was the same comment every time. Unless there is a good documented reason, these should all be set to ignore.
1	1	Add newline.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	1	Have you measured the performance difference with RegionOfInterestImageFilter?
1	1	This is a mis-rendering in Gerrit.
The actual code is properly indented.
1	1	Ack, yeah, that was my first way of fixing the original warning, but when I looked over the class more, I realised just removing the checks would be better... will fix.
1	1	Add spaces inside parentheses throughout, i.e. (XYZ) -> ( XYZ )
1	1	Using itkAssertInDebugAndIgnoreInReleaseMacro for efficiency.
1	1	// We should use deltaPos here, because the actual movements of the point may be changed according to the logic above
1	1	if defined ITK_HAS_TYPETRAITS_TR1_NAMESPACE
 define ITK_STD_TR1_NAMESPACE std::tr1
else
 define ITK_STD_TR1_NAMEPSACE std
endif
1	1	I took out the cast. That was causing the warning I think.
2	1	Line lengths, seems like most of these would be easier to read if they were placed on the preceding line before the variables.
1	1	ITK 4.7 is out :-)

This required could be still added in the version specification to  the find_package call for this example, though.
2	1	Oh, you want it really obvious what type the variable is :)
1	1	should probably also mention the the optimizer scale estmation was pushed into the parent class
1	1	It does not appear that you need this treeColorSet.
1	2	The comment should indicate that using the itk3DVersorRigid transform is often a much better transform to use during optimization proceedures from both a speed perspective (lower dimensional parameter space), and stability standpoint (versors do not suffer from rotational gimble lock).
1	1	You'll get bool to int conversion warnings with these return calls.Fix by 

return this-> ...()? 1 : 0;
1	2	Should GenerateInputRequestedRegion be virtual in all classes?  Perhaps there is not global rule.

[johnsonhj@HansMBAir (git: master) ITK]$ git grep   ""^ *void GenerateInputRequestedRegion""|wc -l
      95
[johnsonhj@HansMBAir (git: master) ITK]$ git grep   ""^ *virtual *void GenerateInputRequestedRegion""|wc -l
      83
1	1	Prefer ordered includes, i.e. VTK headers, vtksys headers, STL/system headers.
1	1	""Toolkit"" usually stands for ""development tool"". See e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_toolkits
1	1	We shouldn't need ${ITK_EXECUTABLE_PATH} at all.  Just naming the executable target will work because add_test(NAME) knows to translate a target name appearing just after COMMAND into the right path.  This is already done for the other tests.
1	1	Run KWStyle in this file.

Fix bracket indentations.
1	1	These methods should also probably go in the anonymous namespace.
2	1	I agree that we should follow master for this and projects like CTK, but it is better explicitly update sha with commits.  Otherwise, upstream can update at any point and builds or tests will mysteriously start failing.  Also, when checking out branches or tags, we will get the versions of CTK, etc that are known to work with that branch/tag of TubeTK.
2	2	itkGetInputMacro and itkSetInputMacro are ITK wrappers for this->ProcessObject::GetInput(#name) and this->ProcessObject::SetInput(#name)

I'm not sure what you think is wrong here, please elaborate.
2	2	bad define.

This is the .h file.

Please run KWStyle.
1	2	I do have KWStyle but somehow I think it only complains if I have end-of-line whitespace. I'll remove the tabs.
1	1	These misaligned typedefs should be causing KWstyle errors. Are you not getting any?
1	1	Not sure about this method. It seems to make sense to me the way Dan explained it but I'm not comfortable giving this change a +2 since I didn't write any of the original code and may not be aware of all of the issues.
3	1	Good catch.  Debugging needs to be removed.  Will remove in next patch set.
1	1	Should this call Free(), or just remove Free() and put that code in here?
1	2	I will remove all of the debug and most of the other messages after the VectorImage is working.  Main reason to use the Logger is to print interleaved messages from multiple threads legibly.  Other reason I'm avoiding debugMacro until VectorImage is working is so that I can continue to see debug messages even when compiled in Release mode for speed.
1	1	No need for indentation on the last line, or even the preceding newline for that matter.
1	1	line length. You can also use qPrintable(m_keyPressBuffer) here.
3	2	Good point.  I'll move to the other block of ITKDeprecatedTestDriver.
1	2	template< unsigned int TDimension, class T >

Prefer a more descriptive name for the second template argument.
2	1	Please remove the word Magic from this file too...

    - edit the file
    git commit --amend
    git gerrit-push

Thanks
1	1	I don't believe that typename is needed here since there is a template present.
2	1	Should the output of this filter always be Real? This cast seems like is should be done outside this filter.

If it's required it may be able to be done in-place for some situations.
1	2	bad indent

shouldn't it be SLERP instead of Slerp ?
(can't change the cast of acronyms)
1	1	Rename objectCollapsibleButton to objectCollapsibleBox or objectCollapsibleGroupBox ?
1	1	Why use a Pointer ?,   the ""const Self *"" should be enough...
1	2	This is not necessary. The same array can be used as multiple ""things"" without any problems. Just make sure that code handles it correctly. Don't forget to update the documentation in the header.
1	1	This seemed to be triggered too hurly. So I'm not sure that actually work.
1	2	This check was removed along with the corresponding GenFramebuffers and GenRenderbuffers calls because they are redundant(see CheckFBOResources bellow) and the allocated buffers are leaked. This is one of the bugs that my patch fixes. In my patch the buffers are allocated only once(with error checking) in the AllocateFBOResources method.
2	2	we can add at the end the following args ""--"" ""-j8"" but that won't work for windows.

Moreover we need to provide the generator. I was lucky enough that the system was picking the last one that I used.

So we might need to stick with a CMake call that configure the pom for you. So maybe for external build tree, that tree should probably became the place where maven should be run instead of the Maven source dir.
1	1	'git commit --amend' and everything up until the last Change-Id line can be removed.
1	1	Method descriptions in VTK must always start with this:
  // Description:
If this line is missing, then the automatic document generation will not work.
2	1	Done, although this filter is specialized for 3D only.
1	1	This is an attempt to clear the following dashboard error:
https://open.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=3611001
1	1	Can I call GetMatrix w/out having called SetDataFrameObject? Add a bried usage description here.
2	1	Smart pointers are initialized to NULL already in there constructor.
1	2	I would go for 2 template arguments InputIndexType (which could be by default IndexValueType or unsigned int) and Dimension
1	1	Maybe this could be outputWriter instead of writer2.
2	1	Hmm notification sounds like a QObject::signals, I'd say that's somewhat misleading. So I'd name that with something indicating the progress Bar.
1	1	I'm not sure if I understand why it should not pick "":/extras/custom3/test"" as first.
1	1	action == 0 is Press and action==1 is SetFocus
Do you plan to move this to QAccessibleWidget??
I guess that makes sense
2	1	Yes, let's improve documentation. Thanks for comments.
1	2	i think there was a problem with d'tors as well. not too relevant, as we don't support unloading anyway.
1	1	need to unify the translation of Ã¢â¬ÅDetails"", to me ""Ã¨Â¯Â¦Ã§Â»â Ã¨Â®Â¯Ã¦ï¿½Â¯Ã¢â¬Å sounds better.
1	1	Yes they are. Most of the shorter methods are from Media Foundation SDK example.
2	1	while you're at it, would it make sense to fill in the remaining cases? Desktop, Music, Movies, Pictures, etc...

the implementations which can be supported using a virtual file system (i.e. media types, as long as the permission is set in the manifest) can be added later, but having the cases here already seems reasonable
1	3	Hi Mehdi, you are right. I am very sorry - I have misinterpreted the deviceRuntimeVersion as the version of DeviceRuntimeOnHostMachine.
2	2	As per discussions on qt-development, it was proposed to have a 3-tier fallback.
1) Environment Variable
2) setConfigFile()
3) A generated default value based on QStandardPaths, org name, app name, binary name, etc.

There was a +1 to this suggestion and no dissent.
1	2	preferably remove this empty line. you apparently have the wrong commit-msg hook. how and when precisely did you obtain it?
1	1	I'm removing those checks in the other modules too. This is the new way.
2	1	Be prepared that these logs won't show up. At least they don't on my Windows machine.

Seems like logs outside the test itself do not appear.
1	2	This is the line which triggers the crash.  createQmlObject() requires the calling context to be valid.  If this callback is invoked from C++ via the event loop, it has a chance to crash.

Note that using Damian's repro also uncovered a crash in QNetworkAccessFtpBackend::closeDownstreamChannel() which could hide the crash issue in QML, but that's a separate issue which needs to be tracked separately (the fix is trivial, just a null ptr check on the ftp ptr).
1	1	Well I need a way to tell whether the newestConfiguration is enabled, since the 0 returned by defaultConfiguration() does not mean that, instead it means there are no configurations at all. How else do you suggest I could expose it?
1	3	My theory of this test: count goes to zero because the delegates go far enough out of bounds to be destroyed.  But because of the easing formula, you have to flick harder to make them go that far out of bounds now.
1	1	Ãâ¢Ãï¿½ÃâÃÅ ÃÂ²ÃÂ½ÃÆÃâÃâ¬ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂ½ÃÂµÃÂµ Ãâ¡ÃÆÃÂ²Ãï¿½ÃâÃÂ²ÃÂ¾, Ãâ¡ÃâÃÂ¾ ÃÂ¿Ãâ¬ÃÂ°ÃÂ²ÃÂ¸ÃÂ»ÃÅÃÂ½ÃÂµÃÂµ ""ÃÂ½ÃÂµÃÂ¾ÃÂ±Ãï¿½ÃÂ·ÃÂ°ÃâÃÂµÃÂ»ÃÂµÃÂ½"" )
1	1	this should better be moved to a signal in IWizardFactory then, I suppose. but different patch.
1	1	I will update the currently commented font.family in another change. I will need to add the font first.
2	1	Maybe name this installToDispatcher() or something like that? I had a hard time understanding all the different classes.
1	3	i wonder where you see that - i don't. maybe it's not explicit enough for your taste in telling you that you are an idiot if you try?

make the setup script simply refuse such qt versions.
1	1	Flow control keywords must be followed by a single space
2	1	Could you add a quick comment, something like ""Return any uncommitted resources""?

It took me 2 minutes to figure this out even though I know most of this code already.
1	1	Flow control keywords must be followed by a single space
1	1	So it should be also fixed in QCryptographicHash documentation
1	1	ok, but then i suggest you turn that thing into a macro which you can document centrally (QT_SEGMENTED_STRING_LITERAL or so). also, a warning in the QStringLiteral doc would be in order if it's not there yet.
1	1	Why not simply do:

    connect(groupSeparatorChkBox, SIGNAL(toggled(bool)),
            groupSeparatorSpinBox, SLOT(setGroupSeparatorShown(bool)));

?
1	1	yes, that's the point: if it's a *designer* plugin, it needs to depend on designer, as in the other example. but this is a ui loader/widget plugin only.
1	1	why? this makes no sense. you should have just amended it if you didn't want to wait for the roundtrip.
1	2	This is quite sneaky.

This doesn't cover QWebView::setPage(0) for example, you'll still be attached to the old window.

But given that this code shouldn't change too much in the future, calling updateWindow in all different setView/setPage isn't going to break less, so +2 anyway.
1	1	Would be better to name this view rather than window
2	2	I think it is, if you read the documentation of what's happening when there's already a conversion registered, the new conversion function is getting deleted, i.e. nothing will happen. One could of course remove the old converter, but that would be bad if a conversion is happening at the same time in another thread. Therefore it's the same kind of warning as in QObject::connect, e.g.
1	1	is it margin, or padding? 
see e.g. http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp
2	4	This functionality is insanely useful for out of the box development against a random sysroot. This would also be a fairly insane place to remove this if block, even if I was feeling particularly murderous.
1	2	Actually it is just moved, disregard the comment on v1
1	1	next time, describe to which repository they're going.
1	1	More complete would be:

ÃÅ¾ÃÂ¶ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ¸ÃÂµ ÃÂ·ÃÂ°ÃÂ³Ãâ¬ÃÆÃÂ·ÃÂºÃÂ¸ Ãï¿½ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¸Ãï¿½ÃÂºÃÂ° ÃÂ³ÃÂ¾Ãâ¬ÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂ¾ÃÂ², Ãï¿½ÃÂ¾ÃÂµÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ½ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂ¸ÃÂµ ÃÂ¼ÃÂµÃÂ´ÃÂ»ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂ¾
1	1	This displays the opening curly brace, but not the closing one. Is that intentional?
1	1	does that make sense? why not just leave the reservation?
1	1	I think it might be worth a comment up here what this class is intended to do and how it does it.
1	2	no need to be redundant ""described in the report"".

but this is bogus anyway - commit message are expected to be self-contained, and the bug links are merely ""for more info, see ..."" style.
1	3	Hint: Possible incorrect use of Apple-related terminology
1	2	... quite contrary to cases where the string is only compared (or appended to non-empty), in which case QLatin1String is more efficient ...
1	1	The type would be TestNamespace::PtrSecCertificateGetData vs PtrSecCertificateGetData though.

I suggest moving the typedefs below the QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE at line 94. Feel free to ignore this suggestion though since it's valid C++ either way.
1	1	About { on the same line? yeah it's probably on the one below.
2	2	I do not like the lower part here, but if I set ""launchGitK"" function to be only one like this:

void GitClient::launchGitK(const QString &workingDirectory, const QString &fileName = QString()) ...

I get error in gitPlugin.cpp file, on line 424:

    createRepositoryAction(gitContainer,
                           tr(""Launch gitk""), Core::Id(""Git.LaunchGitK""),
                           globalcontext, true, &GitClient::launchGitK);

he can not recognize  ""&GitClient::launchGitK"" part any more if there is no function prototype with only one parameter.
1	2	Still I don't agree on treating the operation differently depending on whether the editor is modified or not. In my opinion this should not affect the behavior. What if, for example, there's only one change in the document, the user adds/remove BOM, but then triggers undo (which would bring the editor to not modified state again)? What would one expect?
1	1	Various tests won't link if I leave the macros out. F.e. tst_qpropertyanimation, tst_qitemmodel, tst_qsettings, ...
1	2	We take an ""error_list"" from the framework here, but ""message"" is passed as an argument. Looking at how message is constructed, this also could be generated here (there is no need to pass it through argument).

So either both message and error_list are this function arguments, or none of them.
1	1	I'd move ModelAdapterSource into the d pointer, and hide all the IPC API from the user-facing API here. That would reduce this to take a QAIM to remote, and a name for it, everything else can be internal.
1	1	Done, added QT_DEPRECATED_SINCE check, and changed to QT_DEPRECATED
2	2	This could be done with a static const char* [] data array, using the enum value as an index. It would generate much less code in the end.
1	1	CONTROLLARE. forse ÃÂ¨ download, forse ÃÂ¨ scaricamenti
2	1	Please use one of the test helper methods which includes a timeout.

Combining the takeResults() into this method does not seem like enough of a reason to add a new wait method. We need to be able to adjust the timeouts in auto testing, so minimizing the number of helper methods is rather important.
1	2	redundant, CUSTOMCONTEXT_HYBRISTEXTURE is defined for sure here
1	2	If there is only one developer path, do not append '0' to the Xcode name. It looks weird.
1	1	There are two cases to be covered: 1) When the tokens are empty (this is the one you did); 2) Also, when you do have 1 comment token but the offset is *before* its begin.
1	3	That commit mentions that a GCC 5 change motivates forbidding -fPIE, but I haven't seen any reason to also forbid it for GCC 4. That configuration has been ""not broken"" since Qt 5.0.

Maybe some rationale for that can be put into the changelog too, because it would seem easy to check __GNUC__ before deciding to #error. 

There *are* also people using boost build and other non-qmake, non-cmake buildsystems too, so limiting the #error could have been wise.
1	1	Why can't this go int QTypeinfo?  (i would like to have it there to enable some feature of QWeakPointer only for QObject for example)
1	1	May be you could add a comment where these constants are coming from?
1	1	inefficient. instead of using contains() above and section() here, one can use indexOf() above and mid() here.
1	1	It was intended to be Modes from the start, but could not be fixed before without braking BC.

Should probably go as a separate commit.
3	1	Good to know, I'd specify this in the doc -- i.e. don't touch *any* QObject
3	2	Next few paragraphs look more like they should be code comments than change description. If there isn't a good place to put them in the code, maybe we should start an engine-internals.qdoc file (which is one big /*! internal */ block)
1	1	but cd() returns bool
I don't think absolutePath() is a valid method call on bool
2	1	If you dig into the code, at some point you will reach a very strange statement (a couple of calls from setCacheSize), qMax(qMin(.....), 25).
The size reported by that might differ from the size specified by the caller, in which case the caller should be informed of that. If you query cacheSize() you will get the value of the variable, not the value that was adjusted after the qMax(qMin...) calls.
1	1	What's the error message? and is that with the latest transform change?
1	1	If we're trying to make this documentation more consistent with other module pages, then I assume this page is meant to be similar to http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qtcore-index.html in terms of listing the types provided by the module, so we should add a list here that link to the following types:

 * Component
 * QtObject
 * Binding
 * Connections
 * Timer

as these are the types provided by the QtQml module.
1	1	I just used take_snapshot of the patched upstream repo, but the commit message could be clearer about this.
3	3	Actually, in case of invalid argument the process gets started fine, it's just that it gets immediately exited afterwards (see line 95).
1	1	Or, if the check is needed, do you mind adding a comment about when this can be false?
1	2	To address the previous concerns about constructing a massive QByteArray in the case of no terminating character: I set pos2 to pos so that the QByteArray is empty in that case.
1	1	It's still an executable file. As opposed to, say, a Linux application that you build on Windows and which has a file with an extension .msi - that would most likely not be an executable.
1	1	unrelated, but 'children and whose children' ain't english ;)
1	1	I think should this be translated(m_xOffset, m_yOffset) instead, because adjusted(x1,y1,x2,y2) will make the rectangle grow
2	1	If the methods of this class are only called from the request handler (worker) thread, then I think locking is not necessary.

A comment describing which member variables the mutex is protecting would be helpful. See the comment in the header file.
1	2	this doesn't make too much sense to me, as this file lives in the same directory (hence double quotes).

and the use of double quotes with private/ is inherently bogus.
2	1	1) returns 

2) Again ""it""... Mum :) returns the value ?
1	1	The map should also be updated, probably via loop and calls to remove().
1	2	""with the transition to ORM all we should care of is the real identifiers of this class, which is id"" Ã¢â¬â that's considered to be not true. Since we(at least I don't) do not know (yet?), which operations will be performed on entities, we cannot tell, what we have to compare. Namely, we have to know first, whether these entities will be processed also with unset id when stored in collections, if so, then comparing just ids spells crazy results. Usually it's recommended to compare some unique business id instead of or along with db ID. See Hibernate recommendation related to id generation / object identity.

Ok, I'll regenerate equals&hashcode using these two fields.

Note: this syntax is Java7 syntax, with direct field access, allowing comparing classes with their descendants (the last thing is necessary due to hibernate design).
2	2	I do not understand... I am not trying to fix the world now...

all I need is to ask vdsm what is its id without having to deal with handling the /etc/vdsm/vdsm.id

are the above valid to this task?

the new code of vdsm-reg will call vdsm-tool vdsm-id --force and get id no matter if it is uuid or generated from anywhere else, this id is required for registration.

if you then want to improve how it is 'generated' you are welcome to do so, it will not break the interface.
1	2	another note for future patch: replace static references by the proper Dao getter.
2	3	huh? namedtuple() is a new-style class (otherwise __getattribute__ won't fly for it!).

Note that namedtuple(verbose=True) shows that it uses __slot__=() by default, so I'm all for the removal of this redundant line. However the commit message is confusing.
2	1	where size is not the issue, and performance is not a big deal like in test, please use range() to mainatain future compat with python3
1	1	what about this case? if user selected sysprep/cloud init in run once (then we get here) but also have payload configured?
1	1	consider using 0.0 instead of another variable called zero.
2	2	I thought of making it public bcoz, I had thought of making a itextpdf library 
wrapper, that can be used to export any reports in future.Like this class doesn't dictate any specific layout and provides methods to create the layout elements of choice although, it currently provides only a small number of layout elements like list,table.
1	1	split to chunks was added, no vms/templates in memory during vds operation.
1	1	i think you can use here getAndSetVdsStatic() to get the vds name, so we will have it in the log, i think it is called anyway for the logging infrastructure (""FINISH"")
2	2	When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively.  The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something.  Even if that happens, it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected).
The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time.  Imo that is more important.
See oVirt Bug 881941 - After a reboot of both engine and vdsm domains take a long time (15 minutes) to recover
1	1	For consistency, this could be named ""storeInHttpSession"".
1	1	Just wondering if _nl_addr_cache and _nl_link cache can be factored somehow with a common helper.
2	1	Please use import for java.util.Arrays, instead using explicitly here.
1	1	You're preforming this check multiple times.
it's better to create a separate function, in case we will need to add a new ""localhost"" name/ip
1	1	no need for this change this, you are not using the ""e""
1	1	""throws"" should be indented an additional 4 spaces comapred to the begining of the function (private/protected/etc.)
1	1	Should be renamed together with the class it tests.
1	4	I see, so I'll leave it to go to /dev/null. But is it enough if our websocket proxy writes to syslog?

About "">= 0.6"": I monkeypatched the methods that are used by old websockify to use logger.

(What I'm worried about is the fact I see duplicate lines in syslog - one line comes from ""journal"", the other one from ""ovirt-websocket-proxy"" and they are identical. I need to investigate this further.)
1	1	indent.

But how about defining

skipontest() {
  if [ -z ""${TESTING_ENV}"" ] ; then
    ""$@""
  else:
    echo skipping ""$@""
}

It should be added to ovirt_store_config (in case the test happens to be run on ovirt-node).
2	2	There is no VDSM action here, only database - just make the command transactive, and save yourself all this hassle.
1	2	I'd probably make this _parseMemInfo. If we see that we need it outside this module we can always drop the leading underscore.
2	1	please update this at https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/39024
1	1	as noted in patch set 2, message should be:
CANNOT REMOVE STORAGE POOL WITH NON MASTER DOMAINS
or something.
1	2	You cannot design an API for logging. We should take out the ""command"" argument and have generic errors. It's easy looking at vdsm.log to discover what was the command executed before this failure.
2	1	For a collection to be searchable, there has to be explicit Backend support (it's not generic, you don't get it 'for free'). So unless *you* implemented search for Gluster Volumes in the Backend, the user will not be able to search. So, unless you did indeed implement this in Backend - please remove this url parameter
1	1	It probably is, but what happens when somebody upgrades the libvirt? Do we require vdsm restart as well? Or will it suddenly start working?
1	1	I think this needs to stay here?
The idea is to have valid NotificationProperties
We need a notification method (currently smtp and later smtp/snmp)
So it cant ba validates inside smtp?
3	1	Good point. We need to make sure that we use jsonrpc.
2	2	The convention is to have all mappers static in order to reduce their instantiations as they have no state. 

Please extract it into a private static class.
1	2	I'll remove it here, but so you know - there's a problem - if someone sets it to null (for example from REST), it fails with NPE in StorageComandBase. but that can be fixed in a different patch.
3	1	if you put editable, no need for editableOnTemplate, its good for both
2	1	Please don't. See my comment in utils.py. Configure the logger with proper formatter instead.
2	1	I thought a little about this. Basically it should work like this:

ImageName is null: there's no friendly name for the image, use the ImageId to list/display the image.

ImageName is not null: there's a friendly name specified for the image but since it can be duplicated (it's not guaranteed to be unique), then we should also give an hint about which image it is (at the moment that's done reporting the initial part of ImageId, just as git does with short hashes).

Now considering this last case if we set ImageName = ImageId, then the displayed name would be something like ""myisoimagename.iso (myisoim)"".

Please let me know if you have a better idea on how to handle this all.

Anyway (beside the image name displaying) I think that the safest way to address this now is not to set an ImageName since in fact there's not an additional friendly name to set.
1	1	did you checked that this change is not breaks other tests?
1	1	This repeats the name of the test, better use convert() as the other tests. If you think it is more clear, change all the tests, probably in another patch.
1	1	I guess above versioning should be updated since API changed
1	2	It would require to change diskImageGuid member to static as well.
2	2	this should be done (if any) when first connection is established.

and I do think that it is a mistake to do so.

please move all the engine variables into engine side, do not modify options, there is no technical need to do so.

this includes the destination address and destination port.

let's makes lives easier for us.

if you call the variable the same, you can even have same file symlinked at /etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d and /etc/ovirt-engine/fence....conf.d/ to provide the same options.

So you can even consider putting it at engine local config.

But please avoid complexity result from database updates, and move the variables to the component that actually use them.
1	1	self._guestEventTime mast be set to time() on vm domDependent or else we would never report POWERING_UP.
1	2	> I think it's cleaner. We do not have to re-implement and maintain different versions start-needed-srv in each script. Just one ""vdsm_init_common.sh --start-needed-srv"" to rule them all.

Here we disagree.

But we repeat our-selves... and not progressing, so we can stop doing that... and progress... as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before.

When a user/downstream maintainer opens the service/unit/script whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why, and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic.

At upstart of have the start/stop convention (yeah... you need something for legacy sysv, but simple if is doing the work), for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies, for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies.

So the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts... I do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of scripts[1]

So we left with rhel only to handle...

This is why I do not understand why we need any common application downstream specific logic.

[1] https://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts
1	2	the name is very generic; yet what it does is just poll for updates. The problem goes away if the script moves to vdsm-tool.
1	2	I must I disagree, but it's a matter of style.
Consider though documenting the fact that the other method's days are numbered.
1	1	There is a bit more information provided by _getExitedVmStats. Do we want to have it as part of an event?
1	1	These two methods are business logic, so they don't belong in the API, they should be part of the AddVm command, so that the same logic is used when using the API or the GUI.
2	1	Please use logs instead of System.out.

You can add a log4j configuration to redirect to stdout if you want to see these printings.
3	2	Suppose I am an administrator,  I will look into the log file to find what is happening in VDSM.  You can not suppose administrator to check the console or the code to know this.  IMO, every faulty path should have a log in the log file.  You can argue that many places in VDSM are not doing these,  but it is a good practice for system service program.
1	3	Ah right I was in the ""library"" mindset, I tried to mimic what RuntimeException does. Yes if we look at what I use here, these would be useless at the moment.
2	1	I would very much appreciate a better name/doc/higher-level-interface. Which are the keys and the values of this map?
1	1	Could we have a single definition of such constants? :-)

Perhaps some org.ovirt.engine.ui.uicommonweb.StringConstants class?
2	1	Dan (and me) like ""Vdsm"" - we already discussed this few month ago.
2	1	should be addAll with casting to List, no?

please verify.
1	1	With ElementTree I can create an Element and provide the attributes as a dict see implementation below it's much easier, minidom is too much limited http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.dom.minidom.html
2	2	Actually, I think initLineModel() should be no-op too; the semantics of it are what happens when a different key is picked, but in this case nothing should change when a different key is picked, right? Both value boxes (constrained value and free text) are hidden all along.

So I would hide them originally, say by extending the createNewLineModel() method, and implement this as no-op.
1	2	My idea was just to drop the parent class and move the methods down to the only inheriting class. But I can modify the __str__ in one shot.
1	1	""""""create a vdsm.config.config clone, modified by tunables

tunables is a list of (section, key, val) tuples""""""
2	2	Doing a blind re.replace on an XML is a bug waiting to happen. The XML has structure and it is safer to use it. Please parse the XML and replace only the element you expect. Unless, of course, you have a particular intention here.
1	1	I would remove the setter, and have a public getter you could always spy.
1	1	I guess this change (New) will be handled in a separate patch...
2	1	Please remove this log, it's a part of the if below
1	1	perhaps replace the whole thing with platform.linux_distribution() ?
1	3	any reason for not using constants from the enum? if you'll ever change the enum,
 this tests will produce useless noise.
1	1	it will be used by the UI from a query: when suggesting auto-completion of all existing labels
2	3	Please add constant for TEST_OTHER_DC_ID, it is confusing you're using the TEST_NETWORK_ID.
1	1	It's a format with the ovirt engine format template, will recover the format.
2	1	string.join() is deprecated. Please use ','.join(vmList).
1	1	s/VURTI/Host Monitoring
It is about to change soon.
1	1	You are right, this won't work without the next patch (use DbGroup instead of LdapGroup), I will check again and I will probably have to merge both this patch and next one into one single patch.
3	1	hmmm... this is strange... ok, we succeeded in authn, but have not yet authz, so we cannot report it here.

we should report only after we have all information... where do we do authz in this case?
1	1	you have create_port function with build in cleanup, it's better to use it
2	1	So this is a kind of helper method? I'd suggest then making it ""private"":

    def _benchmark(self, flavor, ...):
2	1	this is just a nit and I don't actually care, but I skimmed and noticed that  other operation strings were <verb>ing, eg 'Getting'. I'm not sure how consistent that is, or if you want them to be consistent.
1	2	Is sqlite the only DB option to use Ganesha? What about mysql? sqlite is usually not used in production. I'm just wondering why there's such limitation here.
2	1	Looks like the order of the parameters are reversed. It should be expected, actual.
self.assertEqual('available', volume['status'])
2	1	Understood. To me it would have been safer to keep the chain as is, but introduce the validation check explicitly, but if you think this is okay too, then I'll shut up.
2	1	I think you could use a better method name, something like network_id_cmp for example
1	1	For the current situation: core plugins are developed by core team, experimental - developed by PI and Mos-Engineering teams.

In the future: core plugins - certified by Mirantis, experimental - verified by Mirantis, and thirdparty - other plugins.
1	3	Indeed, annoying even more as -i in POSTROUTING is already used in external_gateway_nat_rules (L1468)
1	1	This isn't going to pass pep8 anyway because this line is too long and the parameters to getattr don't have proper spacing.

And why are we still looking at exc.message here?
1	2	This patch evelvate context to fix tempest exeption unauthorized
1	1	Along the same vein of getting the class's METADATA_TYPE when deserializing the response, since you are checking if the METADATA_TYPE is located in the json_dict, you could reference the class's METADATA_TYPE directly.

(I should have seen this in the last code review)

  if DriverInfo.METADATA_TYPE in json_dict:
      <body>

The same applies for the properties keyword check in line 67.
2	2	This is what I figured even if we define a column type as integer it is still allowed by sqlalchemy to have strings!
This allowed user_id to be stored as string regardless of its definition.Things would fail when we have LDAP and a regular DB like postgres.
However this is present in other models like tokens where user_id is defined as Integer.So this all together should be a separate issue.
1	2	the arguments to init should be documented somewhere.
1	2	it seems to me that this operation is not optimal as it would try to find a number in a list, while you only need to check it against 0, 4095 boundaries.
1	2	well, since we're doing this, might as well do this instead, since it's cleaner and looks better (and sanitized).

        elements = getattr(self._conn, class_name)(ElementName=element_name)
        data = self._get_first_item(elements)

And before you dismiss the usage of getattr, That's actually how wmi namespaces work: the __getattr__ method is overriden and it will lookup and cache that class_name and return it, as it does not have it defined. This way it is more flexible, same wmi module works for any namespace.
1	1	Brian - We're not storing the user_token in the cache, we store the data after decrypting and JSON-decoding. If clients were passing in token hashes only we wouldn't know that it was originally PKI.
1	1	should the version be changed now that some methods are not available?
3	1	OK, will change it - there was a debate about whether we should also check for 'false', 'False' etc., which is why it was a list.  I left it like that in case we changed our minds!  Provided we don't, I'll just make it a simple equality check!
1	2	Namespacing is weird here too... ""imageId"" is a Property but ""provider"" is a top-level attribute of a resource. It's also being used here with a different meaning to what has been understood to date (see above).
1	2	I suggest adding the enabled parameter (see above), so this gets enabled/disabled as well when someone calls ceph::repo: ensure => absent?
2	2	Josh, my proposal is to see boot as a helper for deploy driver (or to any other interface or anyone else) rather than to see it as a separate interface.   Boot should just take care of getting the bare metal booted to the required environment - whether for ironic to perform an operation OR to boot the user-requested image.  

Thinking in these lines, I would think boot interface should refrain from participating in cleaning.  Boot interface should participate in cleaning only if it had something to clean up on the bare metal node that would take a lot of time - in my mind there isn't anything.  We can discuss in the IRC.
1	1	For those tracking trunk, we cannot delete this migration.  Just need to make a new migration that migrates the data and then drops this table.
2	1	It would be helpful if the returned structure were described more fully, just for clarity.
2	1	Doc string needs to be changed. This does not return anything. it can be something like-
This function verify detail of referenced datastore.
1	2	This is in the wrong place and will cause multiple prints per class when running in parallel.  _inject_tag_mapping moves variables to unittest result object
utresult.mapping.var moves to utresult.var.
However the vars aren't being used so it does not do anything.
The dump_results handles printing of the results for the parallel version and as such needs to be updated to achieve what you are looking for.
1	2	project_id is none by default here and in _delete_tokens_for_user. Is the same if project_id is not provided.
3	1	if so there will be some problems here - i mean, to authorise we need password/token - token is really not supported in that version of nova_client. dunno what password to use here - where we're using ctx from trust. Using service user creds here is not really a good idea.
1	1	nit: The part1 patchset is ""port test_hypervisor into v3 part1"", does not include ""nova"".

so how about removing ""nova"" from this part2 patchset, or adding ""nova"" to part1 patchset.
2	1	I think we only support mysql, sqlite, and postgresql in the migrations. (Mysql doesn't need this step because it stores  indexes in a namespace per table. This step is only necessary in postgres and sql because index names are in a db-global namespace.)
1	2	these are essentially renamed to ProjectScopedPayload.version etc in a dependent change: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/162196/
1	1	cpu_allocation_ratio is a global config option fro the core filter - not a per hypervisor setting ?
1	2	I believe Greg thinks there may be a performance difference depending on SSL termination in the pipeline - but I think he's wrong for our APIs and clients - we could test, or we can review after we get something working and revisit it later if there is problems.
1	2	Here we can assume that because the if statement above checks to see what extensions are enabled. If the config option has a single entry in the list, 'all', that means all extensions are supposed to be enabled on nova. 

I just chose Hosts here because I wanted an extension that problem wasn't ever going to be removed. (also one that wasn't many characters)
2	1	With auto-generated CRUD methods you don't need to define these methods manually. Please check this patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/62865/
2	1	please move command to system.py so this can be reduced to ""cmd_node_init"".
2	1	We kind of discussed this last time - and thought that we didn't want to fail any calls if the operators were not recognised..
2	1	This is better, but the registered variable is unnecessary:

while True:
    ...
    if register_models():
        return # or break
2	1	I just noticed this: please change god_mode to override_state as in this change: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/156203/8/nailgun/nailgun/test/integration/test_capacity_handler.py
1	1	Need to use:
with self.assertRaises(ex.NotSingleNameNodeException):
    validator.validate(cluster)
1	2	Add:

    When you copy a manifest object, the new object is a ""normal"" object -- not a copy of the
    manifest. Instead it is a concatenation of all the segment objects. This means that you cannot
    copy objects larger than 5GB in size.

    All metadata is preserved during the object copy. If you specify metadata on the request to copy
    the object (either the PUT or the COPY), the metadata overwrites any conflicting keys on the
    target (new) object.
1	3	I would suggest changing the name of this, we actually use Neutron Drivers for spec reviews (confusing I know, given line 61 below). Since each of these has it's own review team, perhaps we can somehow indicate that here?
1	3	I guess the big question is whether it is sufficient to test the functionality by mocking out getaddrinfo() or if we need to actually make the call. If the former, I think it could go in UT. Lets see what others' say.
1	2	This may result in broken implementations since they could already have a longer URL. Highly unlikely, but possible.
1	1	I don't see this as needing more prominence here, so much as the increase in docs is *an entire second proposal* wedged into this one. I'd vote for merging as is, and making the docs process a standalone follow-up.
2	3	If all you are doing here is testing that the object returned by Network.get_by_id is passed to the allocated_fixed_ip() method properly along with some other arguments, the more clean and canonical way of doing that would be this:

 @mock.patch('nova.objects.Network.get_by_id',
              return_value=mock.sentinel.network)
 def test_add_fixed_ip_instance_using_id_without_vpn(self, get_by_id_mock):
     net_id = networks[0]['id']
     with mock.patch.object(self.network,
                   'allocated_fixed_ip') as allocate_mock:
         self.network.add_fixed_ip_to_instance(self.context, FAKEUUID, HOST, net_id)
     get_id_mock.assert_called_once_with(self.context,
                net_id, project_only='allow_none')
     allocate_mock.assert_called_once_with(self.context, FAKEUUID,
                            mock.sentinel.network, address=None)
1	1	You're right. Ivan,tenant_id is non-admin tenant need to change to admin tennt id here. will fix it in next patch.
1	1	nit: this sentence has six commas and two separate alternations ('or's). Maybe it could be split up?
1	1	""apt-get"" is distro specific... perhaps make it clear that this is an example and that other systems would be installed differently
1	1	Because SQL migrations requires it for work on the ec2 credential table.
1	1	Is it confirmed with UI team to use this distinction?
1	1	Not sure why all these if statements are necessary... see the definition for optional_str() on line 579
1	1	This should be a programlisting with language 'ini'
1	1	Function call for single line that removes from dict?
1	2	Do you plan to address the runtime problem with N calls to cinder, where N is the number of hosts?
2	1	@jichenjc, @Chris, I will do it separated blueprint, thanks
1	2	I'm still trying to understand what this new logic brings to the table...after all of this effort, we are still just enforcing that the project/tenant-id that created an entity (secret/order) is the same one that can perform operations on that entity. However, the database relationships used in the entity queries enforce this, so what does all of this do that is different? If we were doing attribute-level access control, it might make more sense to me, but entity level for tenant-id RBAC is redundant to the db queries to me.
3	1	I guess it can be interpreted that its just being pointed out that this is a dependency, not necessarily that its a new dependency. And its good to have this documented.
1	2	Not sure where these param are from args or kwargs? Suggest to doc them clearly:

        :param args: ...
        :param kwargs:  A dict of keyword arguments to be passed to the method, 
                        which should contain: Ã¢â¬ËusernameÃ¢â¬â¢, Ã¢â¬ËpasswordÃ¢â¬â¢, Ã¢â¬Ëauth_urlÃ¢â¬â¢, Ã¢â¬Ëapi_versionÃ¢â¬â¢ parameters.
2	3	use mock.patch.object, also should be able to use the decorator like on the other method.
1	1	we must make sure the paste file is in absolute path mode:
config_path = os.path.abspath(config_path)
?
1	2	IMHO, we should explicitely add coverage for the method you're adding so we could isolate any problem later on
3	2	These are good, but I think we need another test which exercises the untested path in fault.py. Otherwise, if it is in fact unreachable, we need to eliminate that code path.
1	3	The use of 'count' confuses me. Would this be cleaner?

    self.assertIn('Unexpected method call', unicode(e))
1	1	This is an unrelated change that should be dropped.
1	1	Read my comment regarding this in previous patch sets
1	1	possible way to remove this constant and use information from setup.cfg:

    import os
    # Read setup.cfg of OSProfiler
    open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))), 'setup.cfg') as setup_file:
        setup_lines = setup_file.readlines()

    #Parse version
    for line in setup_lines:
        if line.startswith('version'):
            version = line.split()[-1]
1	1	But what we are using is oslo version. I think this should be fixed in oslo. I submitted a patch to oslo https://review.openstack.org/56211
1	1	When using this many parameters, using named parameters is preferable to make things more clear
3	4	A better way to do this is
| awk '$2==""id"" {print $4}'

it suffers from less false positives on the 'id' string, and it's more efficient.
1	1	instead of this simply add ""creation_date_time=creation_date_time"" to __init__ method bellow
1	1	This should really check self.client.can_send_version() and send the primitive of the object with the old version if you can't send the new one. You can find examples of this in compute/rpcapi.
3	3	I like calling *somewhere* rather than inline policy-conditional code. I don't like that I have still exposed policy-specific's in line 528 :/

  newest_file = durable_file or data_file or ts_file

I nearly changed this to pass the ondisk file set to is_obsolete() and let that method take care of (a) determining the policy-specific newest file and then (b) determining if the file under test is obsolete. But backed off because there would be a slight loss of optimisation because as it stands, the loop is never executed if there is *no* newest file.

I guess a call to a policy.get_newest(file_set) would do it. But what I'd really like to do is have a policy.get_ondisk_files() method return the wanted set and optionally the unwanted set as result of a single iteration over the dir listing.
2	2	if your job is parse the service_profile to then pass it to the driver, just let the driver take care of this directly. Less cross-talk and better separation.
1	1	I think *both* initramfs and kernel image should be downloaded even if one of these files already exists. Otherwise we might end up with a version of a kernel different from that of the modules (in initramfs).
1	3	you could use `self.patchobject` from HeatTestCase, that does all the boilerplate for you. Or use @mock.patch.object as class decorator, as you seem to use this mock in all tests.
2	1	self.SECURITY_GROUPS/self.SECURITY_GROUP_IDS
self.NETWORK_INTERFACES
1	1	Should this be all of the groups and not just controllers?
1	1	At least put // @todo something. Helps us keep track of what still needs to be looked at in the codebase.
2	1	Please use:

  pywikibot.Timestamp.now().isoformat()
1	1	http://en.wikipedia.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Hurricane_Celeste_(1972)
1	1	It would be would to expand into '... main stats view in rt server' or similar.
1	1	We ironed out the issues on bug 49965, a few patches are linked from it.
1	1	Adding {{delete}} is because that was previously in this script:
http://git.wikimedia.org/blobdiff/pywikibot%2Fcompat.git/d5a3b0349e0264a298d909d03455283f3f154fb2/casechecker.py
2	1	Should be tied to the wiki it was started from, like the other global actions, in my opinion.
1	2	Do we need to enforce the same type for all elements in the array, or do we not care as long it's one of the string/numeric/numeric string primitives?
1	1	Then this one can use SHA1 and another patch could change the existing instances.
2	1	I did not get your point, please fix it as you think appropriate.
1	2	Is there a selector you can use with $.closest so this doesn't look so godawfully clumsy?
2	1	New messages don't have description in MessagesQqq.php or maintenance/language/messages.inc
1	1	You can't make changes directly to OOJS directly here.
You need to check out the oojs repos (gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/oojs/core.git & gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418/oojs/ui.gt), make changes there, and once they are merged create a separate change which updates this concatenated file. Then you can rebase onto that change.
1	1	Is this marked 'latest' in the other place it's defined?
2	2	Right. Then why do you have the method_exists() check? It looked like you meant to check if a method exists before calling it but then never called the method. Just type hint $article as a WikiPage to make this clearer and get rid of that check.

last_edit_title definitely needs a rename.
1	1	this parameter doesnt currently exist in compat; I dont know why it is being introduced here.
1	1	title.getPrefixedDb() gives the target article title, but in the apply() function it's looked up by href, which may be a redirect title.
1	1	This line ought to use the variable to say:
'token' => ""A token previously acquired with $action"",
1	1	Hook parameter.  I need to print it, I think it holds the CentralAuth ""Logging you in to the following wikis""
2	1	Oh right the $ to global is a nicer idea.  I have just removed jquery statement and did not add the global.  That is just a few errors and they do need fixing.
1	1	This should be references with an 's' Ã¢â¬â see Cite.git, i18n/core/en.json line 38.
1	1	Yes, and it does. I submitted an amendment with a better comment explaining that.
1	1	Why did you add this back? It's not needed as far as I know.
1	1	Ahh, I see.  :)

I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class.  Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead?

Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader?  Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?
1	4	I really dislike modifying unrelated code. (All around.) All this is going to give us is merge conflicts. You're not even consistent, you left ""$(this)"" unchanged.
2	2	Minor and optional cleanup: I think we can drop support for mw:WikiLink/* at this point both here and in magLinkRe.
2	2	Woops! Sorry. I'll fix this in the upstream (well, it's my upstream after all) and add a patch to the queue to update the library.
1	1	This is unnecessary, only MWExtensionInspector uses nodeModel
1	1	setPageTitle() takes a Message, so no need to change anything here.
1	1	Should probably say ""... we are not clicking on the menu button""
2	1	@BearND You're probably referring to the idea of returning the normalized location of the face (instead of the absolute coordinates in pixels)... I think we can take care of this in a subsequent patch; and it's not immediately clear whether it will simpli
1	1	Can we write a test for this? It seems to be an important semantic aspect of the interface, worth recording.
1	1	I think columnName is a property that indicates a column's name.  I'm going more for ""which column should we extract from the file"".  I thought about maybe columnToUse.  I'm not sure because this configuration is going on a wiki page.  I'll change it for clarity, we can think about it more when we do the mediawiki change.
1	1	Well you could combine both:

  match = self.site.redirectRegex().search(oldText)
  if not match:
      break
1	2	So does this method import to both the in memory cache and the disk cache? If so, that would be the source of some performance hits. 

This method should:
1. Add the image to the in memory cache synchronously
2. Add the image to the disk cache asynchronously

If it doesn't do this currently, lets split the logic up now.
1	1	I assume this is something that's required if signature is not provided? If so; throw an exception here; or remove it completely from code.
2	1	This was directly copied by Special:Random, but you are right.
1	1	Say what the commit does (add release notes, apply CSS only to content, formatting fix).

If you want to put an ID, put it in the body (and using the git SHA of the previously merged commit is better so it works on both GitHub etc. and Gerrit).
1	1	Use a proper sentence, and this routine does more than that, returning encoded version.
1	1	P.S. - now that this is an attribute of the campaign, not an action, we need to change the i18n string to ""Archived""
1	2	how about use default wikitext namespace (see getDefaultWikitextNS below) or allow specifying namespace as an argument?
1	3	am i confused, or will this get the above error ""Invalid host name (docroot="" . $docRoot . ""), can't determine language."" ?does it need to be in an other ""} else if {""?
2	4	I swear I read somewhere on Smashing magazine along time ago that all pseudo selectors are less performant but I can't find such an article. I can only find these 2 references (not sure of there credibility):
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4082077/first-child-is-too-slow-alternatives/4082105#4082105
* http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/05/03/css-tricks-how-to-speed-up-css-rendering/

I think the main thing I would say is whilst integrating with VE we should avoid them where possible. Use of first-child might invite us to use last-child and other selectors based on the idea. I do think we should be avoid nth-of-type and nth-child at all costs but I'd expect first-child and last-child to be less evil!

That said browsers are getting better and better these days and we could just make the decision that we will use them and wait for browsers and VE to catch up.

As tech lead, let me know what approach you want us to take. Happy either way. Please can we get the outcome documented on the coding guidelines page?
1	1	The output HTML is along the lines of ""<dt>{{int:this-message}}</dt><dd><a href=""/w/api.php?lots=of&parameters=here"">api.php?lots=of&parameters=here</a></dd>"". The colon seems implied by the <dt>; I'm not sure whether it should be added in the messages or with CSS or just left implied, or if we should have these be punctuated as sentences and ignore the semantically-implied colon.
1	1	I guess jcuken is an alternate keyboard. How will we test it? Narayam does not support non-qwerty keyboards
1	1	This entire code above this comment can be deleted as long as the ""dp = node.data.parsoid"" is fixed to set it to {} when node.data or node.data.parsoid is missing.
1	1	Agreed, it would be better in a different tree.  It does need more documentation and testing for other applications.
2	2	mw-mf-overlay-header seems like a rather meaningless class name. I wonder if we should move away from it to something more meaningful?
3	1	Do you need to check $result['edit']['result'] === 'Success'?
2	1	Yeah, done. Removed the function and function calls. Thanks.
1	1	I put it here because i think it belongs to the Apache site more than other places
1	3	The incorrect spacing gets fixed here - https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/121369/
1	2	I generally prefer not to be credited in source files.
1	3	This is done now. The regex will now not be applied on some invalid versions where it was before. Some types of invalid versions will still match the regex, though that is outside of the concerns of this function. It is not a version number validator after all.
3	1	If it sounds funny, I should fix it.  Your explanation is a good approximation of what's happening.  We are limiting traffic...  Any suggestion for how to improve?

Hmm, I think I see what you mean.  We are not changing the amount of traffic, just the proportion of that traffic which is ""going"" to the campaign.  What about, ""Throttle impressions""?
1	1	It's feeling funky and not particularly DRY in here.  Do you think we should have a more consolidated response handler, then have these functions simply access already processed data?
1	3	This whole last block from line 187 to 191 could be simplified to 

return skipIfLastMatched != null && skipIfLastMatched && cache.lastMatched;
3	4	Ah, good catch. I didn't see the enclosing call to the Title class there. I was assuming the output of $request->getVal( 'title', '' ); was being passed to $request->getVal( 'returnto', .. );

Seems some really nasty logic going on with re-using variables and type-casting to strings etc.
1	1	change this to /srv/deployment/mathoid/mathoid

the duplicate mathoid is so if you have any other repos (eventually) or a temp dir, or an output dir, it can all be in the same place
1	1	The point is to use double quotation marks "" instead of single quotation marks ' for consistency within MediaWiki core and all extensions.
1	2	Because of presence of data-parsoid, this is not a new block level image. Title or test needs editing.
1	1	Shouldn't be here (or anywhere, see my comment below re select).
2	2	It's a nice feature; does it cause a particular problem?
1	1	This means the folder structure is not as expected?

I guess we had always as follows:

/pywikibot
/pywikibot/comms
/pywikibot/... <others>
/scripts
/scripts/i18n
/scripts/maintenance
/tests
/tests/data
/tests/i18n
1	1	Are these data representative of the inputs that the function receives? AFAICT you're not storing individual collections in sub-pages.
3	3	But not how it's currently implemented. Instead the interwikimap should be consulted to see whether a interwiki link is local, and as soon as a non-local interwiki link is happening throwing this exception (but as InvalidTitle of course).

How is en:meatball:Foo an invalid link? I've added that to the link tests and it's fine. And en:meatball:en:Foo doesn't work as the meatball wiki appears to have no interwiki map.
1	1	No, /index.php/Foo is an Apache-mod_php-ism, not a guaranteed feature. Standard PHP anywhere else does not include that handling.

You're going to have to explain how you expect 'redirected from' from a HTTP redirect would be handled. Because so far everyone who's attempted to turn redirect pages into HTTP redirects while preserving 'redirected from' properly has failed.
1	1	Hm, alright, fair enough. Most of the code I've seen uses mw.msg(), though.
2	1	This works. :) Still, I think it might be nicer to do the check and call the error page from showBannerEditor(), since that's the method that mostly deals with output. This method just returns an array for form generation, and may be called more than once in a single request.
1	1	Why not put this in begin(), so that all subclasses will have the trxFname logic?
2	1	Yep, not sure why it was using a string there. Thanks.
1	1	A title being edited will not show up in action=post-history.
3	1	There should be some separation of code from the rest of the text, even if it's clear that it's a URL, to ensure that nobody gets the idea to translate it. <kbd> may be enough, but having quotes, too, is a good idea.
1	1	The three tests above that checks namespaces should probably grouped together. They seems to be copy pasted and just change which setting is gathered.

You could uses a dataProvider too. That will build an array of tests cases and pass the case to a test method.  Anyway, you should extract the foreach / assert in a new internal method such as assertNamespaceIsValid()
1	1	Agreed. We will need to get this repo setup and populated before these changes are approved and applied on any hosts.

Can anyone confirm if I have guessed an appropriate name for the repository?
1	1	I'll let peter decide what he wants to email; but changed the subject to include the host name.
1	1	I think you also need to add -.7em to this 24px. That number comes from the .fulltext-search left and right margins. Otherwise there is a horizontal scroll on the page.
1	1	Copy the password hash from $oldCentral to $newCentral?

You should probably run that idea past Chris first.
3	2	changed to prefix operator++ (and further down in the code, too)

I had it mostly coded with date serial numbers, but had to make functions that are available for class Date. I could only find appropiate date serial number functions in the sc/addin/analysis module, a module that I would rather move entirely to the 'normal' calc function module once the Excel-analysis-addin can be considered obsolete. IMHO that would reduce the complexity of the calc-function code.
I will peg Date to date serial number conversion as a toDo item on my lo-task stack.
2	1	GetDate() does not return a date serial number, it returns a ""formatted"" number with YYYYMMDD, see include/tools/date.hxx how nDate is stored in init(), which is returned by GetDate().
1	1	Why an extra header file? The definitions can go directly to settings.cxx
1	2	These 2 functions should return const OUString& to avoid unnecessary copying.
1	2	Using a direct english string here means it can't be translated :-(

You can do a grep for e.g. RID_SVXSTR_LOAD_ERROR for a sample trivial translatable string example you can follow to get a translatable string here
2	1	Why would you remove it ? Please keep gid_File_Bin_UnpackUpdate untouched.
2	1	please make the comment style consistent (so here it would go behind *pDfltFrmFmt)
1	1	stylistic issue - declare variables as close to the first use as possible
2	1	Please verify this is correct :-). This is as far I know the ""most special"" change I made, other then the OUString things.
1	2	Tying this to --invisible is not correct. With --invisible there is no UI, so collaboration would be quite challenging ;-)

I think with a proper Listen/Unlisten implementation we do not need a command line option at all, or do we? A ""listen always"" option instead should go into the user configuration at the end, IMHO.
2	1	Is there a reason we are not doing stuff like the below, which seems to me would better across a wider range of machines:

// lockFocusFlipped not available before OSX 10.6
if ([pimage respondsToSelector:@selector(lockFocusFlipped:)])
{
    [pImage lockFocusFlipped:YES];
}
else
{
    [pImage setFlipped: YES];
    [pImage lockFocus];
}
2	1	Hi Miklos,
I have mentioned the relevant comments for this impacted UT in the commit message as well. Kindly have a look. Thanks.
1	1	Also here, not MX/RX but instead

 {..., 4, 6, V, { VR }, ...}

compare with ""BETADIST"" and ""BETAINV"".
1	1	shouldn't it free the allocated memory here and return null if mkstemp() fails?
1	1	If this line is removed the rDescription parameter name (and only the name) needs to be commented out because otherwise in an --enable-werror build the build breaks with ""unused variable"".
1	1	same as above, aStr += m_sFormula.copy(nFml, nStt-nFml)
1	1	These nOpCode have of course to be eFacOpCode then.
2	1	Hmm, what is this misterious newly to be created LangID value? I've put 452 but I'm not sure...
2	2	I believe you just need to convert directly.

Look at sal/inc/sal/log.hxx, it seems to verify if the test is true(in this case if these strings are equals) and show the message

If we're wrong, someone will tell us :)
2	1	not sure how important this is, but other lines seem to have a tab at the beginning of the line and the added lines uses spaces. :D
2	1	That instead should be

 const sal_Unicode* pParseEnd;

because rtl::math::stringToDouble() expects

 sal_Unicode const ** pParsedEnd

at that place. Code probably shouldn't even compile like it is.
1	2	It fills the functionname <-> opcode mapping from a list of text resources in RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES in formula/source/core/resource/core_resource.src
2	2	Thanks a lot for your review.
What do you think about ""in the adapted class""?

Anyway, I'm going to bother some of the guru to hear what they think about it...
1	1	This says 6 parameters, of which 3 have to be given and 3 are optional. If the function expects 4-6 it should be

 6; 0; 0; 0; 0; 1; 1;

You can check in the Function Wizard what/how it is displayed.
2	3	Same here. Please, use empty lines instead of the ugly separators in this file. It is too compact and hard to read after your change.
2	2	OUString::replaceAll does not modify the OUString but returns a new OUString instead.
this means that when converting an existing String *Replace* call you need to assign the returned value to the original string.

you should get a warning about an ""unused result"" here but strangely
i'm not seeing a warning with gcc 4.7, no idea why...
at least the Clang tinderbox caught the problem.

fixed in commit 03a381eaa58d77cf26dfa8d916d1ecda865c1937
1	2	this is bogus: for IOS now both --with-darwinssl and --with-nss are set
1	1	Do not remove the entire statement, SeekGroup() has side effects.
2	1	use functionDecl->getLocation() instead of functionDecl->getSourceRange().getBegin(), so the caret is nicely positioned under the start of the function name
1	2	Well - these files are still generated by autogen.sh, if no autogen.input is present. And when I asked on IRC, people told me they are still used.

Actually I was told to keep the minimized info message to move config from autogen.lastrun.bak to autogen.input, instead of some more prominent header.

I actually don't see a reason to deprecate the configuration via autogen.sh commandline arguments. For me autogen.input is just an other way to configure stuff.
1	1	The built search tree of mdds::flat_segment_tree is not preserved on copy/assignment. You have to call build_tree() here. Or do it just before use (and use is_tree_valid() to check if it is necessary, as every line is used more than once).
1	1	There is a comma missing after share/gallery/sounds .
2	2	No globals please if at all possible.

But more generally, this is a base class - please stick specific functionality into derived classes. You already did that in SlideFragmentHandler for parts of it - for PPT_TOKEN( text ), when it comes in the SlideFragmentHandler context, just generate a new child context - e.g. like new SlideTimingContext( *this, mpSlidePersistPtr->getTimeNodeList() ) in that file.

With that, you will get rid of that global state anyway.
1	1	should this patch only be added if $(SYSTEM_MYSQL) is NO ?
1	1	Note that these can be usually written simpler as just """" instead of OUString().
2	1	The change here reminds me that also some of the new oc..._MS opcodes may need an entry here. Could you take care of those in a follow-up patch?
1	1	the old code only replaced one instance not all but the string shouldn't contain more than one anyways...
1	2	By the way, why are you adding patches for specific platform w/o $(if $(filter blah?
3	1	Yes, this is correct! The error was introduced by bbc94edb9a91b27910d43610db9994df10dd99e1
2	2	How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing.

Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any ""only for import / only for export"" usage needs to be implemented differently.
1	1	tdf#... is unnecessary. Rather document why this is done, if necessary.
2	1	The replaceTo will need to use the newly to be created LangID value.

Same as for bo_CN, are the codes verbatim copied from dz_BT in which case only a ref=""dz_BT"" would be needed? Or aren't some needed to be adapted to IN country conventions?
1	1	The word ""Selected"" should be capitalized. I'm unsure of the use of ""Area"" here, BTW. Maybe ""Cut Selection""?
1	1	should be a local typedef in the single function that uses it
1	1	this code now returns a reference to a temporary object
2	1	Please note the comment on SC_GLOBSTR_STR_COUNT, which is the overall count of strings. So actually you need to insert and define STR_TABLE_COUNT to 533 and increment the value of SC_GLOBSTR_STR_COUNT to 534.
1	2	actually, if we get rid of nIndex, we would have to change a lot of code, because in this one, the Insert method returns the index of the inserted/already existing element.
1	2	I don't see why we should reject a number entry that we can ""understand"", just to adhere strictly to the locale, but I'll ask an expert what LibreOffice does in other areas, and we should just ""do the same"".

My assumption is that we should definitely accept native digits, but why reject ASCII digits?
1	1	Can you clarify what is meant by ""ListBox => PreNotify() ...""? That doesn't make things any clearer...
1	2	These two comments seem to be for the block of commands.
2	1	aChild is a ONDXPagePtr which is derived from  SV_DECL_REF(ONDXPage) which has an ""ONDXPage & operator*()""

but the old code called operator<<(ONDXPagePtr&) which does something different than the ONDXPage& one!
2	1	please remove ""border"" and blank line between class definition and comment and consequently reduce it to a single line
1	2	might as well drop the conditional and just assign it
1	2	i thinks that's the wrong one, the one that should be FROM is the ""pl"" library
2	1	the condition !pProfile->m_bIsValid must always be true here, so rather use SAL_WARN
1	2	Sorry, this is still unacceptable. ImplEESdrWriter::ImplWriteShape() is used by both the binary export and the OOXML filter, you need to set the OOXML flag in the OOXML filter. Jut put a breakpoint on this line in the debugger, see its backtrace, and set the flag in the first method that is already OOXML-specific, and pass the bool around till this line.
1	1	Better would be to have

 if (nGlobalError)
 {
     PushError( nGlobalError);
     return;
 }
 if (aInputString.isEmpty())
 {
     if (GetGlobalConfig().mbEmptyStringAsZero)
         PushDouble(0);
     else
         PushNoValue();
     return;
 }
1	1	See other comment about OUString together with ScResId. Just as short explanation:

The current code creates a SchResId object which has an operator OUString which is called here. Then the OUString copy c'tor is called to generate a copy from the returned OUString.
1	2	>OTOH we might grep in ""$@"" for ""project:"" and only add project:core if none was given.
but then we could do the same with branch and status: default branch = master, default status = open => logerrit query would be translated to core/master/open. How about it?
1	1	For the final commit remove ""[part 2of 2]"" and join the ""ODFF function FDIST"" to the first summary line.
3	2	Conversion was done for binary files to be stored in earlier formats. Encountering such versions isn't the case anymore with copy&paste and conversion would never be executed, so that code could be removed along with the check. If you want you can remove that code in a follow-up patch, getting rid of unused code is always good :-)

Probably the reason why you had to add the check if a version is set at all is related to that, actually the stream should have the version SOFFICE_FILEFORMAT_CURRENT set so all parts involved elsewhere that do check the version get that correct. Would be nice if you could spot the place where that should be done. Anyhow, I'll push the current patch as is.
1	1	If AddSdrObject() method, test goes into infinite loop. Because there is already AddSdrObject() function with same parameter which is mandatory in both cases. So should I add new method in parent class?
1	1	the propvalue parameter type is not quite idiomatic ;)

In general - since this method gets called multiple times, prolly worth buffering the xml ...
1	2	* ""@return void"" is redundant, leave it out

* but do add a line ""@since LibreOffice 4.4""
1	1	It is my update of this help page:
https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/XML_File_Formats
It should also link to Expert Config page, but it does not exist yet.
2	1	So that means to also change comparisons with STRING_NOTFOUND (which is defined to 0xFFFF), lastIndexOf() returns -1 if not found, so the condition here can be simplified to

    if (nPos > 0)
1	1	there is a warning ""unused variable w"" here ... i'm guessing this should compare w.size() with 3, right? i'll push a fix for that to master...
2	1	please don't do that
keep the 
if (condition)
   stmt

structure
1	1	if a comment is behind the field it describes, doxygen needs ""///<"" (with a symbolized left arrow) to realize it correctly
2	1	Here too, you can access maBaseCell.mfValue directly, since we know ahead of time that both cells are of value type.
1	1	If this is never called - then we need to remove the method, it's signature in the header, and all call-sites for it (right?).
1	1	yeah, just wondered how likely that would be in combination with OStringBuffer?
2	1	Why checking for null pointer here? delete handles null pointers just fine, you only add overhead here.
1	1	Same caveat here about indexOf() and Search() results.
1	1	Probably ""Selection count"" (note lowercase 'c') is better. This is the string displayed in the status bar.
2	1	This switches on distinct locales only, not on a primary language value where the secondary value may be different. This should instead be

 switch (ctl & LANGUAGE_MASK_PRIMARY)

and ...
1	2	Right, changing an SwField, which is part of the document model during export is bad. An export operation should just read the document model and serialize it in some format. Can't you set m_bCitation depending on what the field type is? Just put a breakpoint on the SwField constructor, get a backtrace and see where it's created -- hopefully the caller knows the field type.
1	1	presentation::AnimationEffect aEffect = presentation::AnimationEffect_NONE;
1	1	I was being consistent with the hybrid pdf tooltip which used 'makes'.
1	1	Note that the rtl:: prefix removal is planned to be done by a scripted change somewhen in the near future, so while this change is ok, it should be less work for both you and the review if you do not specifically aim for these changes.
1	1	Again, you must continue the original numbering and then update LAST_STR_HERE.
1	1	IMHO the probe*XML functions should simply take xmlTextReaderPtr. shared_ptr is only used to manage the lifetime of the reader, so it is impl. detail. I would even remove the typedef.
1	1	Nitpick: The pointer is only set in the ctor, so it should be const. Similarly in KEY2StyleContext.
2	1	Put this into a DEPS variable and reuse the value above in gwt_module() too?
3	1	Oh, thanx!
I actually did not know that it was possible ... like Code Review for team learning :-)

Will fix in the next patch-set.
2	2	I don't think the comparison with the SshCommands (or RestViews) is fair. For SSH commands we have a simple lookup by command name and it is all that matters.

For project rename tasks it may be (and probably is) critical in which order the steps are executed. It is not just a set of tasks that can be done in any order. For a critical command
as project rename the order of tasks execution should be explicit. At least it has to be documented. Right now, one has to look in the TaskModule, then in the DynamicSet and find out that, internally, it stores its items in a list which means that the iterator() will iterate in the order of the elements as they are in this list. And this is not even documented/guaranteed behavior of the DynamicSet.
1	3	This creates an unnecessary garbage list. Sets.newHashSet should accept an Iterable.
2	2	Thanks for fixing it.

> What if the author disagrees with your negative vote and writes a reply to your comment explaining why he disagrees? If this change is filtered out there is a high chance to you miss this reply. 

But with this argumentation it is even more dangerous for me how it was originally:

  -label:Code-Review=-2,user=self

Why? I am maintainer and have power of -2. I review a change and decide to put my veto on it. But we all do mistakes, we all have feelings? In the end we are all people. What is if it was a wrong veto? The contributor try to explain me, in additional comments why he thinks the veto was wrong and that the impact of the change is *very* minimal and that thousands of people from hundreds of companies can't upgrade to the new version of the product and all that because of his veto. Nothing helps. Why?

Because I used your dashboard template, put this line and this change was filtered out:

   -label:Code-Review=-2,user=self
4	1	Ahh that's funny! :D

Good that you payed attention!

Done
1	2	Two trivial comments:
-Why the leading ""d""?
-Why not %x instead of %d for the row version?
1	1	Moving this logic to ProcjectControl will also require additional modifications in ReceiveCommits. My approach fixes both issues in one place. Also this approach protect us from making same error in future.

Personally I wouldn't move this logic to upper level. Signature of this method can be changed to canCreate(Map<Stirng, Ref>, RevWalk, RevObject) instead of using Repository. But IMO will keep this logic here  to prevent from this issue in future.
2	1	Concatenate the calls to append:

 StringBuilder msg = new StringBuilder()
     .append(""n"")
     .append(""Can not find the %s at this location: %sn"")
     .append(""Please provide alternative URL"");
1	1	I suggested to add aliases = {""-#tag""} in this comment:

  https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/60106/8/gerrit-server/
  src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/server/git/ReceiveCommits.java@1155
1	1	Instead of putting everything in the collector and then looping through later when outputFormat==JSON why not switch here on outputFormat and thus allow results to be printed immediately for JSON and collected only for JSON_SINGLE?
2	1	Yes.  Actually, look at what I just merged to master with the query operators, in particular you might want to read the documentation in user-search.txt.  You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted:

  is:open CodeReview+2 Verified+1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2

If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true.

By making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>, and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible.  That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.

So the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.  We have the code already done to handle that as a string, and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.
1	1	It was only referenced from the description text in rest-api-accounts.txt which is deleted by this change. Since the JSON entities of the REST endpoints are described directly in the REST API documentation I've moved the description of the QueryLimit over to rest-api-accounts.txt.
1	2	>This isn't a link to MySQL.

Done.

>I think most/all of these requirements are redundant and already covered in the general installation section?

The JDK is, but tomcat isn't.
1	1	It's now streaming the progress to the client.

Done
1	2	Perhaps I misunderstood Martins comment.

But yes. I create a new change-id in ChangeUtil, so this is expected (and by design), but it has nothing to do with the footers.

I do not change the change-id in the commit message - since that is not expected (git would never do it). I personally do not want the new change to have the same change-id (internally) as the old change. Is that something you really want?
1	1	This example contains both actual examples (""refs/*"") and metalanguage (""permission""). Maybe pick one representation and stick to it?

 [access ""<ref>""]
         <permission> = group Administrators

or

 [access ""refs/*""]
         read = group Administrators

(Open re what formatting to apply to metalanguage.)
2	3	Yikes, we are starting an RPC for every row in the table?  My concern with this is the browser can only issue 4 requests at a time to the server.  If a user has 50 items in their dashboard, which many do, this will take quite a few round-trips (13!) to completely load the status codes.  Worse, if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading, they will continue to load, as there is no way to cancel the queued RPCs.

I would prefer having myApprovals and strongestApprovals take a Set<Change.Id> and return a Map<Change.Id, Whatever>, and make only one call to each method for the dashboard.
2	3	I don't think we should let people modify a branch that they don't have access to, even if it is for a commit that they are replacing that used to be in another branch. Locked down is locked down, right?

I see how it might be annoying to have to redo a change if you used the wrong branch the first time, though... Perhaps there is some Git magic that can let you do that painlessly?
1	2	What happens if match is missing or empty? Does it do something sensible when trying to match against an empty pattern, or should such commentlink rules be skipped (e.g., with a 'continue;' statement here)?
1	3	No need for Provider here, inject FlushCashe directly. Both PostCaches & FlushCache are singletons. So the Provider hurts more than it helps here. E. g. on line 105 it get called in a loop and returns allways the same singleton instance.
3	1	I checked, and git does not clear the environment to run hooks. I also can't find subversion's reasoning around clearing it, so barring finding out that there's a good reason to, I think I'll just remove this line.
1	2	This just feels wrong. The test setup code should not be writing to the notedb separately; there should be a method in PatchLineCommentsUtil that writes to the appropriate storage(s) based on the config.
1	1	* Bumping the schema number forces a reindex to pick up the new file format.
* LuceneChangeIndex has:

    this.useDocValuesForSorting = schema.getVersion() >= 16;
1	2	PatchTable$MyTable.onClick(ClickEvent) line: 299 will also call  movePointerTo(cell.getRowIndex());

 sorry I try every corner and cannot find the difference after adding this line.
2	1	--add will add a value on top of another/others. The above line will replace any previous value with this one. Not sure which effect the author is looking for, but I personally don't understand why you'd want to have several download.scheme variables?
1	1	This does not correspond to an issue on the gerrit issue tracker [1].

Issues should be listed in the change footer in the form:

 Bug: Issue 1234

[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/list
1	1	You are missing Schema upgrade and SchemaVersion. See for example this change [1].

 [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/56641
1	1	Combine both the if statements into one single if statement.
1	1	Should it be possible to rebase the change if having submit permission, but not rebase permission?
1	1	I don't want to change the actual messages in this change for reasons stated above.
2	1	It looks like this allows a user who cannot see all branches to probe which branches exist. By looking at the error message ""it doesn't exist"" vs. ""user does not have rights to delete it."" a user can detect if a branch that is not visible to him exists.
1	1	I wonder if eventually we should put these in the file table as well :)

Not in this change, though.
1	1	Hi, so should we keep this as ""local"" or change to ""mergeStrategies""?
1	2	I'm not really liking this name, maybe just 'Resources'?
1	1	If a user term isn't returned I believe you'll get NPEs when displaying lists of changes. That's why I wrote https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/35201 so that this error is discovered early and is properly reported. I was a while since I looked at it, and the code might've changed since then, so don't take my word for it.
1	2	It feels wrong to be doing this sort of checking in this class, it is huge already.  I suspect that passing in the appropriate merge strategy via the factory would be cleaner.
2	2	Is this necessary though?  Would anything bad happen if we encode to utf-8?  Also, it looks like this exists to make sure that we aren't using utf-16 or something else, in which case we would definitely want to keep this even in python3.
2	1	Correct, I mentioned in the commit message that it's undocumented.
2	1	We probably should ensure the project is clean before doing this, otherwise a user might lose uncommitted changes they care about:

  project = Project(
    manifest = self.manifest,
    name = path,
    remote = RemoteSpec('origin'),
    gitdir = os.path.join(self.manifest.topdir, path, '.git'),
    worktree = os.path.join(self.manifest.topdir, path),
    relpath = path,
    revision = 'HEAD')
  if project.IsDirty:
    print >>sys.stderr, 'error: cannot remove %s: uncommitted changes are present' % project.relpath
    print >>sys.stderr, '       commit changes, then run sync again'
  else:
    shutil.rmtree(project.worktree)
1	1	Done in https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/38303
1	1	More or less the same steps as described in the comment Sep 13 11:50 AM change:

 https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/46171/16/gerrit-pgm/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/pgm/init/InitModule.java

Can you try it with non existing H2 Database:

 <Resource
    name=""jdbc/ReviewDb""
    type=""javax.sql.DataSource""
    username=""""
    driverClassName=""org.h2.Driver""
    password=""""
    url=""jdbc:h2:file:/home/davido/projects/test_site_auto/db/ReviewDB""
    maxActive=""100""
    maxIdle=""20""/>
2	1	nit: wording.  the sentence doesn't make sense. perhaps:

Support creating a request for authentication of a remote...
1	1	Just use 10px. I also rebased on latest master and adjusted look and feel of buttons here to match the changes made in context of [1].

 [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/62460.
2	1	I've double checked the (REST) command i used to delete emails.  It wasn't a typo because I used the exact same command with an admin user and it worked just fine.  It was only when I used the user with canModifyAccount permission that it didn't work.   Could the 'not found' message be from the Email.parse() in Email.java requiring Administrator permission?
1	1	Why not to include topic when this really implemented?
2	2	As far as I can tell from documentation, no exceptions are thrown.  Reworking it slightly anyway (move chdir closer to _FindOrphans loop) and adding try/finally for safety against possibly careless maintenance programming.
1	1	OK.  I'll check if [1] still works with asiidoctor before pursuing it any further then.

[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/49451/
2	1	I got the idea for adding such a message from your change (only you had it even more verbose adding a message per approval that was copied). I can try to incorporate this into the patch set created message, but not sure if this is easily possible.
1	1	""that all 4 projects are imported"" or ""that it imports all 4 projects""
1	1	Be consequent with naming of method an var?

  isAVisible() {
    return aVisible;
  }

or

  isVisibleA() {
    return visibleA;
  }
1	1	Optional nit: this could go on the same line as excludes
1	1	Suggestion: so it is recommended that it not block...
1	1	Do we have a working solution if one still need the Gerrit-Module?
1	1	as Shawn mentioned in another comment: s/wild project/AllProjects project/

more occurrences below
1	1	What happens if the specified branch doesn't exist?  Will that be caught by the check at line 154?
1	1	Must have been something in formatOne at some point. Not sure why Eclipse didn't warn me. Done.
2	1	refs/users/ is sufficient prefix. No need for refs/meta. We should be plural like changes heads and tags.
2	1	There is no putComment method. Shorten this and just put it on one line:

  checkState(psId != null, ""setPatchSetId must be called first"");

Developers debugging a failure can look at the Java stack trace to see how they got into this situation. What matters to them more is the call site where the object was misused, not which entry point into the object the error was discovered by.
2	1	On second sought: actually you don't need this file (endpoint) at all. We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method, after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo. The only reason to have this class is to get the UiAction for granted (Guice DynamicItem binding and discovery).

But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now, on the client side, from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too, obviously.

This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all? We could add it to main page (or may be just add a keyboard shortcut), in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name (with suggestion oracle for project, like it already does for branches).

I don't have strong preference for one of these solutions. So, you can let it as is for now and wait for opinion of other reveiwers.

1	1	Make these transient and lets just handle the serialization entirely ourselves.  That way we don't have to actually hold onto buf when we have the object form already on hand.
1	2	Wasn't the trailing slash already removed when the GitHub URL was read from the config?
2	1	Hi Edwin

 thank you to have a look.
 I removed them, because current version of ProjectsTable already has these 2 lines content .
 I test this feature and  find 'k', 'j', 'o'  can work.
 
 with or without this feature, 'Enter' hot key can not work. we can test by 
 https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com.
 I ever try to only add 
 {
 keysNavigation.add(new OpenKeyCommand(0, KeyCodes.KEY_ENTER, Util.C.projectListOpen()));
 }
 but Gerrit feels not happy and give  a running time error  http://i.imgur.com/4pL2N.png.
 I guess its a bug at some corner of Gerrit.

/Bruce
2	1	Done

it looks like Gerrit missing a feature:
remove comments, that don't make any sense, like these below ;-)

Thanks for the hint with java_library and resource.
1	1	this should be 0.

I believe the empty username is a valid name.
1	1	Can this actually happen? Wouldn't revision have to have _number 0, so the previous comparison would be false?
1	1	nit: this import is not needed anymore and can be removed
1	1	I suppose this is readable, but it's a lot of boilerplate compared to having a single callback each for comments/drafts with the if in the body.
1	2	Right, I would assume the problem occurs when the user doesn't intend to sync to a fixed version.

However, if that's the case, I'm not sure just switching this to only happen with current-branch-only will be enough. We at least should update the docs for --current-branch to make it clear that it will have this behavior and that if all objects are desired, they should run sync without -c (either for all projects or just a specific project).
2	1	Because we don't need anything that it provides (checking that the value is not None and encoding it) so there's not much point pulling it out of the loop below. Actually, we would have to leave it in the loop below as well since it uses the `env' outer variable.
1	2	How are these two arguments joined together into the target string?  Or maybe these should be passed as-is and let the XML RPC server join them together?
1	1	This method now only sends email; I would change the name to reflect this fact.
1	1	I think this should say Alias for 'gerrit remove plugin' (see line 150)?
1	1	The previous one says ""server assigned"".  Is the difference intentional?
2	1	Since there is a Gerrit issue [1] for this bug, can you please add a reference to this bug as footer?

  Bug: issue 871

[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=871
1	1	This causes a warning about missing UID in Eclipse.  Fixed with:

https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/59929/
1	1	You should wrap the following code into a try/finally and close the pdb when you are done with it.
2	1	Hrm, I'm not sure how best to handle this.  StackOverflow has a 'Display Name' attribute, does anything similar exist for LDAP & OpenID?

I'd prefer to just show the firstname to save on space.  If we end up showing the full name, I wonder if we could put the name to the left of the search bar and have the search bar expand over it when active, to save on horizontal space.
1	1	all 3 log methods now do make use of the instance variables: accountCache, groupCache, groupBackend
1	1	or  ask the maintainer to commit the change on the author's behalf.
1	1	#NAME?
2	2	Nit: While assimulating is a word that seem to exist, my only association was that it was a misspelling of assimilate. This leads me to believe that it's a word that non-native English readers might have trouble interpreting the right nuance of. This is the commit message however, so in this case it isn't the end of the world, not many will read it compared to the actual guide. :)
1	1	Is this already done in the LCD code? Maybe not...
3	2	There are two RPC calls to be made to download artifacts |download| and |wait_for_status|. Sync means that you can use that artifact after |download| has returned. Async means that you must wait until |wait_for_status| has returned. This is done so that we can start kicking off a suite run before we fully finish downloading everything we might need.

The |download| call happens as part of the RPC call that's made to autotest to kick off a suite. The |wait_for_status| RPC call is made as part of dynamic_suite code (see dynamic_suite.py:450). By the time you'd be kicking off your firmware test it would be assured that the firmware tarball would be downloaded. Therefore, I would think it should be fine/safe to make this async.
2	1	Patch Set 2:

I would suggest two commits. The first one is just the import without and mods. The second is a git mv of the ebuild file to the -r1 name and enabling the patch. This is done so that we retain history of pristine upstream ebuild and then successive changes to them locally.  So in this commit just pull in the upstream ebuild  as is, and a follow on with the modification. 

Thanks
3	1	Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks fine though agree with Chris's comment that exported strings should be defined in a header file that can be shared.
3	1	Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

(2 inline comments)

LGTM with a couple of small optional suggestions.  I agree that using more realistic sites to consume memory would be nice, but I think getting something up and running soon would be valuable as well.
2	1	The variable you should probably use here is U_BOOT_FDT_USE, defined in make.conf.

I agree the name is not great - we can change it if you like. But the intention is that this variable tells you which fdt to use, so there should be no need for this sort of logic in ebuilds.
3	1	Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

LGTM; and yes please do upstream.
1	2	Patch Set 1:

These are used in decoding also, so yes they should obviously be enabled when possible. Alternatively, someone should rewrite all this in intrinsics and verify it's not slower.

x86inc.asm works when:
(A) we're 64bit
(B) we're 32bit, but pic is disabled
(C) we're 32bit, pic is enabled, but the final binary is linked with -mdynamic-no-pic (or a non-gcc equivalent).

x86inc.asm doesn't work when:
(D) we're 32bit, pic is enabled, and the final binary does not use -mdynamic-no-pic or a non-gcc equivalent during linking

My understanding is that Chrome on win32 does (C) (i.e. the windows/msvc linker does gcc's -mdynamic-no-pic behaviour by default), so there's definitely an argument to be made for keeping these assembly optimizations.
3	2	machine_emergency_restart is a good place for the cache flush in the sense that it is already machine-specific.

But yes it's fine to take this approach. LGTM
2	2	Patch Set 5:

> David - it used to be that you needed to land both the 
> stable and the 9999 cros workon ebuild at the same time.  
> Has that been fixed and you can just land the 9999?

That's right, you only need to land the 9999 now. (Actually it's been supported since at least Oct 2010, but yeah there used to be a bug)
1	1	Hmm I see what you mean. Yeah it might be possible to do what you describe.
3	1	Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Would wonder about chattr during runtime, but yeah you're likely right (assuming this has been image tested too).
3	2	Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I don't see the need for this change. If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin.

The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it.

The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit.

Even if you do want to split things out like this, it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the RO image based on a use flag.


Independent of whether splitting things up is a good idea, if Mike (who knows bash much better than I do, I think) likes the style of the new function you've made, it would be nice to incorporate the style changes back into the original function.
3	1	Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

I concur with jrbarnette@.  It sounds like we can do a separate issue/CL for removing the pragma.  To that end, I think a TODO() referring to that issue could be useful if added to this CL.
2	1	NIT: a docstring of this Exception would be useful. Including the error above this.
2	2	1. This seems like a hack to work around a bug -- why are we reading from the pty after it is closed?
2. This hack also looks too broad -- if any error occurs we close the pipe and stop reading, while squelching the error. This seems bad.

Same comments below.
1	2	a bit weird that you have this error change in Populate but not in the constructor
2	2	Ah.  Yes, the test_wait_for_sleep() method implicitly assumes
that sleep has already been triggered, but that won't be true if
the trigger happens asynchronously.  :-(

At any rate, looking at test_wait_for_sleep() and
test_wait_for_shutdown(), it seems like their only purpose in
life is to hard code the timeout, and raise TestFail, neither of
which you want.

So...  the right answer would seem to be to rename
_ping_wait_down() to drop the leading '_', and just call it a
public function.

Also, the hard-coded timeouts here need names, and some
justification for their length.

1	2	Patch Set 4: Fails

Unit tests fail for chromeos-ec so no changes can be committed until this is fixed :(
1	1	EAPI is not required to be numeric, so this will fail when it is a string
1	1	Patch Set 3: No score

Removing fails since I tracked down the failure to the previous CL.
1	1	Is snd_pcm_close() the same as snd_output_close()?
I expect to see ""snd_output_close()"" called before this return. My preference would be to see use of ""goto error_out"" or something similar in all the ""if"" failure cases.
3	1	OK here are my thoughts:

The error handling is fine, but the message doesn't mention bootstage so it isn't clear where the failure is. I think you should fix that.

set_bootstage_prop is called twice with the same path. In both cases it calls fdt_path_offset() to get the offset. You may as well just call it once here, immediately after your strncat below.

Then you set_bootstage_prop can be passed a node. In fact this function just has a call to fdt_setprop() so why have it at all? Just call fdt_setprop_cell or fdt_setprop_string instead, which are better suited to your requirements anyway

Re working_fdt, I do prefer a single reference to a global rather than multiple spread throughout the file, but if you remove the function then this is not an issue anyway, I think that the whole of this for() loop should be in a separate function called from bootstage_report() if working_fdt is not 0. It should be passed working_fdt as a parameter,

I just tried this change on tot gavd on my waluigi and it didn't detect headphone insertion. I went back to just tot, the change renaming udev_listen -> udev_sound, and it does work.

I know the commands for alsa were not flushed out yet in the max98095 codec, is that the problem right now?
1	1	IMHO this two functions are unnecessary.
There are only validates (oh my...)
Better if will be done in the level using the parameters.
2	2	Hi,
Correct me if i'm wrong - but, we have 2 instances of commands in the flow you described. This means they do not share state. The change done by Arik adds messages on the canDoActionMessages() collection of each one of the commands. Not sure how you're going to have this mix.
2	1	Patch Set 2:

Greg, 

Thanks for the info.  I agree with your assessment on caching as well.
2	1	I agree that a trailing ""or"" is missing here (though defining a function is_configured and putting the grep's in it would have been better than any commenting. I cannot say that I like duplicating bash logic in English)
1	1	I agree with the above comment ... the above logic change  should be in a separate patch than the channel handling
2	1	Maybe you could add a real description - yes it's just something really minor :)

2	2	The if condition will be true when isDetailsRequired() == true and volumeName is empty. Will it work? Do you need to add a validation against this scenario?
2	2	Patch Set 2:

Liron, so lets think:
Reconstruct flow:
Go throught all vds refresh and on case of some exception connect.
Recovery flow:
Go through all vds connect and after that refresh, no need for exception handling on case of exception at refresh.
especially additional refresh.
No need for additional method that u introduced.
Where it is 99% percent common. You already introduced a method that at some flow should return only true and complicated a very simple code. ""right now there is no need to copy the method in my opinion - 99%"" - your change at connectAndRefreshAllUpHosts in order to solve bug at reconstruct flow caused to regression in recovery flow. I don't think that these means 99% common.
2	1	I understand that right not only root is supported by engine, but I prefer that the API layer will pass to the engine all the information that the user provided. Engine may choose to ignore, for now, all users aside for 'root'. 

The way it's written here, is just a bug waiting to happen - tomorrow engine will support other users, and suddenly we will have a bug in the API: some users are not passed on to the engine, for some reason.

well - we seem to have a race where we fail to connect to socket after migration, and guest information is not reported, adding logs on one host seem to 'resolve' the issue.

1	1	Patch Set 2:

The Jenkins failure is an unrelated foobar.
1	1	This does not really explain what the issue was.

When new SD creation failed, failure status was not checked and flow continued to try and attach the SD to a pool which obviously failed and returned a storage domain not found error instead of the creation failure.
SD creation status is now checked before proceeding.

2	2	Will we miss adding the server if the status change command failed on it? I guess we should add it if it fails with ""already enabled"" error. Not sure what we should do if there is some other error though. Maybe we should let the sync job handle such cases.

verified behavior.
There is a problem when selecting a key and value remains empty: Validation isn't being performed on the client side and it fails on validation on the engine-core instead (i.e. CanDoAction).

@Kay: Well, that's exactly what I am saying. It has been like this ever before and has not much to do with the card layout (but I agree that it is a bit more prominent now).

If you edit a record in the upper right corner there is a button which opens this record in a new window. If you do this and go back to the original window and continue editing the same record you have exactly the same problem, it was there for ""ages"".

But OK it is a nice feature and I will not discuss the commit message any more, no one will care until it is merged anyway.
2	2	Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hi ananth,
I agree with Markus that I'm in favor of not merging this.

What xml parser ate you using that is not capable of empty, closing tags? Esp. if you set the HTML tendering mode to XHTML, the output is a subset of XML.

If you need to have empty closing tags replaced by q dedicated closing tag for a special use case, you could ask on http://forum.typo3.org to figure out a solution for you. I'm confident that it's possible, however I would not change TYPO3's default behavior.
Thanks for your understanding.

Yours Steffen

2	1	Patch Set 2:

as this is pending for almost 10 months now, what should be the next steps? Do we want that, if yes we need a ticket in forge, Release info in commit message and probably the unit test changes.

Otherwise we probably should drop the change.
2	1	Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

@Sebastian: Yeah we already discussed that, but since we don't have time to implement promises or similar for 1.0 it's still better than before. So for now we make sure to fetch the stuff early, but I agree we should add a TODO in there

2	1	Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Seems like you commited some too much ;)
3	2	Patch Set 5: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Rebased with current master

Took comments into account. Using 4.3 in deprecation log as it is like that in config_default but using @deprecated with 4.6 and remove in 4.8 to stick to our rules.
3	3	Patch Set 4:

Although already merged, I don't think this is the right solution. 

Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use ""checkLanguageAccess"" only if the TCA for the table has a ""languageField"".

""pages"" is not such a table, because there is ""pages_language_overlay"". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the ""Original Language"" is to remove the permissions for editing table ""pages"" and only allow ""pages_language_overlay"". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794

This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess.

Similar problem we have in the ""List view"", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more ""aggressive"" than in the GUI.

Correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has ""edit permissions"" on the ""pages"" table - just like TCEmain also does.

As this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on ""language restriction permissions on pages"" in the first place before fixing the GUI.

I am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but I am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5.

Maybe in your research you find out different aspects than I did or you can prove me wrong as I have only touched the ""surface"" of the whole complex. Please let me know!

2	4	Patch Set 1:

Sorry, the news be module is completely broken for me ... sql error, then namespace errors ...

but the news be module with 4-7 suffers from the exact error my patch has fixed which would be reintroduced with this ""fix"".

On top of that, there is no point to check for the object we just created, thus we either remove the check, then we are back to the state before my patch which creates a warning.

Please tell me the exact error that happens, otherwise I can not reproduce the regression.
2	2	maybe add TRUE as the third argument for using strict comparisons?
2	2	I read it as alternatives to TRUE are ... so all upper case would still be the default. But, actually, I would not mention the alternatives at all.
2	2	Patch Set 1: Abandoned

TYPO3 4.6 branch is at the end of bug fixing period. Only priority changes will be considered (compatibility fixes and security fixes) until end of April 2013.
2	1	I know - but maybe it would make sense to correct it right away instead of creating a separate bug report which doubles or triples the effort to get it done...
3	2	Patch Set 3:

I have a separate TYPO3 installation running in an alias on the main site - that is in /home/. So domain.com is one TYPO3 installation and /home/ is a separate one using alias in Apache.

This works fine given that config.absRefPrefix is set to http://domain.com/home/

The automatically created JS and CSS has the filename http://domain.com/typo3temp/.... in the compressor. So conceptually it is actually not an external CSS/JS, but because of the absRefPrefix - TYPO3 think it is external.

Does the above make sense?

This patch fixes the errors in the log where php tries to execute filemtime(""/home/domain.com/home/htdocs/http://domain.com/home/typo3temp..."")
3	1	Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Just fix those three whitespace errors in the test class.
1	1	Will fail with: ""uid , pid , crdate"".

I think the following would be better:
/(^s*|,s*)uid(s*,|s*$)/

I added space checks on both sides because TS objects can be also created programmatically, so spaces are not necessarily trimmed.
3	1	Patch Set 6: Fails; Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Rebased on master. The changes introduced come from I076a02096fb62bb1b8a51d888287d68c6ca26965, which was merged after the ""security"" topic was rebased, reviewed and verified by Robert.

That change also reactivated a number of tests, of which three still fail in this state of the codebase.
2	1	Patch Set 2: Fails

unit tests fail for me, please hold on (investigating)
1	1	Patch Set 4:

The failure has to do with the locales available on my system. de_DE.UTF-8 is not available, but when I change it to en_US.UTF-8 the test is ok.
3	2	Patch Set 5: Verified by team member; Looks good to me, approved

The last patch set adds an @outputBuffering to the test Bastian added to avoid failure when running PHPUnit in strict mode.

Submitting with prior approval.
3	3	Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Looks good to me.

I consider the possibility of a fatal failure in (core) development context no big problem, as a core developer should know how the caching works.

Thanks for your reviews.

To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning.

Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the ""patch for a patch rule"" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think).

Please don't treat this as harsh words, I just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us, and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the TYPO3 community.

Thanks for your support!
Steffen

P.S: The reason, why Jenkins fails is probably, because of the parent commit is very old and the patch has to be rebased. Will try to get this done now (if network connection allows)

Looks like we have this logic to avoid re-creating osc proc entry in osp_mod_init but its counterpart is missing in osc_setup(). So if we have osp loaded before osc, we get the failure inserting osc module.

The error now gets hidden with this patch because lprocfs_seq_register() only warns about it and creates duplicated entry in parent's subdir link. Then subsequent lookup only finds the newly created entry and it can cause random failures.

2	1	I'd prefer create lost-found/MDTxxxx dir in the way client does, that is MDT0 alloc fid from MDTxxxx and create this dir like a normal mkdir.

1	1	This is device init path, is not it?
So changing the od_track_declares after the fact would not retroactively enable this feature?

We might as well change it to a module parameter then if this is the way we want to go?
2	1	Could we encapsulate the 64BITHASH functionality into the FULL20 flag? I believe there are only two minor issues that are currently handled under FULL20, and both would be easy to fix in the 1.8 branch as well if we want to add support for 64 hash values there.

1) client must zero the o_gr field in all OST requests

2) client must compute the early reply checksum on the full reply
buffer size instead of a fixed size (88 bytes, IIRC)
2	3	This seems confusing to me. It reads like ""If -ENOSYS is returned on the 1st iteration, then FMR is not supported"", which gave me the impression that ""-ENOSYS can be returned in later iterations too, in which case it does not indicate FMR is not supported"".

Rather, please consider:
if (rc == -ENOSYS) { /* device does not support FMR */
      LASSERT(i == 0);
      break;
}
1	2	hmm, why this should be a problem? attr is a local (to this thread) storage, nobody else will see that?
1	1	This should also be updated to match the actual latest kernel version as above.
1	1	As you noticed in your former review, my patch originally allowed this by the presence of a MSG_IS_ERROR flag that was passed to the callback. John suggested we leave llapi_printf() alone.

Next patchset implements your suggestion with two distinct callbacks, which I find clean & flexible.
1	1	(style)  code indent should use tabs where possible
1	2	error: lustre_disconnect_lwp():'lwp' dereferencing possible ERR_PTR()
1	1	int or long (underlying ssize_t types) should be OK to return this?
1	1	warn: lov_unpackmd():variable dereferenced before check 'lmm' (see line 392)
1	1	(style)  code indent should use tabs where possible
1	1	it's just not correct to skip ./.. in OSP because it doesn't know whether this is a stripe or just regular directory which we can access via OSP.
1	1	(minor) Why out that in a comment instead of just using $((1024 * 2048)) below?
1	1	(style)  unnecessary whitespace before a quoted newline
3	2	There have been complaints of late on the mailing lists about configure not auto-detecting whether servers should be built or not.  I wonder if this will be good enough to fix that issue also.  Might be worth seeing if there are open tickets about that and closing them when this lands (assuming it does fix those cases).
1	1	(style)  code indent should use tabs where possible
1	2	(style)  code indent should use tabs where possible
(style)  space prohibited between function name and open parenthesis '('
1	1	this is per loc_handle which is CHANGELOG_CATALOG handle. This should remain here and set per each MDT catalog but not per whole context.
1	1	(style)  cfs_list_add is deprecated, use list_add instead
1	1	This fallback code and ioctl is very old (around 1.5), and meant for handling the case where ""/proc/fs/lustre/devices"" doesn't exist (e.g. no lprocfs configured).

This could be deleted along with jt_obd_list_ioctl() and the OBD_IOC_GETDEVICE ioctl I think.
1	1	(style)  Do not use whitespace before Cc:
(style)  Use a single space after Cc:
(style)  Unrecognized email address: '$CC'
1	1	is this equivalent to:

lmm->lmm_pattern &= ~cpu_to_le32(LOV_PATTERN_F_HOLE)
1	3	consider this as a sanity check. the important thing here is that directories (at least before DNE) can't be striped, so we should not try to use LOV EA as a striping information for destroy, etc.

so, instead of checking in destroy and setattr for type, the trying to load striping, then check whether striping exists, just call the function and no striping will be created in memory for directories..
1	1	Should we set ""io->ci_ignore_layout = 1"" under such case? then subsequent layout processing can be ignored.
2	1	[suggestion] Please use the following codes to do the operations in parallel:

local list=$(comma_list $(osts_nodes))

do_nodes $list $LCTL set_param -n obdfilter.*.read_cache_enable=1

do_nodes $list $LCTL set_param -n obdfilter.*.writethrough_cache_enable=1
2	1	Why does this need to use conf_param?  Since the JOBENV value is only useful on the client, it could be set directly on the client without adding the complexity of setting it on the MGS first and then waiting for the MGC to be updated:

                $LCTL set_param $FSNAME.llite.jobid_var=$JOBENV
1	2	declaration of ""tv"" can put in this block, but it's not kernel code so it's not a big deal.
1	2	For coreboot, maybe you could insert:

   assert(OpFlag == AccessWidth8);

before the ""if"" to ensure that coreboot users aren't tripped up.  I'm the first guy to discourage unnecessary changes to vendorcode, but this code is broken and we should somehow warn users about it.  It would be even better if we could make the code fail by static analysis instead of a runtime assert.
1	2	Do we really need a separate header for two trivial definitions?
1	4	I'd expect rules.h to help here as well. Even if the logic is a pain/messy it's better to put those constructs in a single file.
1	1	I assume this is not a memmap version of 16550/8250?
3	1	If it's not set, there's no way to get FSP failure data out.  I agree that it's not an absolute requirement, but without it, if there's a failure, you're going to be pretty lost.

We could move it from here and put this below, surrounding the #if statements and not actually fail, but my opinion was this was the best option...
1	1	This bootmode is allover the place in ACPI too. I was considering doing enum with follow-up later.
1	1	The mode of both files was changed to 755, that means the executable bit was added.
2	1	The value is having an ABI compatible way to pass the proper information to ramstage from romstage. There's no reason to allow something that can change to break in the future. Take for example the current different sizes of the previous space reserved in the cache_as_ram.inc files. Things that are brittle will break.

What is the bare minimum amount of info that needs to be passed? Isn't it just a bar and a couple of endpoints?
1	2	To clarify: what is so odd about that is we don't have any way to ensure or car_data section doesn't intrude on whatever region FSP may be using. i.e. I thought that was the point of the contract provided by what was passed back from FSP.
1	1	You may want to check for NULL because cbmem allocations can fail.
1	2	These r characters at the end break our Git commit hooks checking for coding style issues lint-stable-003-whitespace.
1	1	Why is this called a console util, when in fact it's a UART util?
1	1	I think I'll cherry-pick, rebase and add the bootblock.elf and coreboot.ram fixes in #750.. makefile half-baked output.
2	1	Why not just adjust the check upstairs to 
(m->total_size?:2048) > (microcode_end - (u32)c)
then you won't need this check if you assume that cbfs is correct and if you don't cbfs check belongs to cbfs functions, not here.
1	1	Where do they live then? And then shouldn't we remove VBOOT_CFLAGS here?
1	1	Where do we handle the COMPILER_RT_rmodules_$(4) ? Is that just included in the objs ?
1	1	You assume here that size of phdr entry is sizeof (*phdr). You should use phentsize instead.
1	2	Is this called from the outside? If not, it could be made static...
1	1	The ---??ª?? is not the coding style I think. Could we change that right now?
1	2	Is it possible to put this init function inside the nehalem romstage ? Or are there any problems
2	1	this could probably be determined dynamically at build time. but not in this patch.
3	1	ewwww. Longer term, why are we not just using monotonic timers on x86? Still, this is known good, we can take it as an action item, as there might be a reason.
3	1	I have added the modulo because if int is actually 64 bits then the snprintf would mangle the string for values >= 2^32. OTOH it is quite unlikely that we ever see such high numbers(?), but you are right it is not really a good solution. I'll push a version that will work with 64 bits ints and the refined error message. Thanks a lot for taking the time to write the review!
2	1	Whitespace. It even replaced the proper tabs from before. Please fix the editor.
2	1	It's left intentionally like that, so that a patch that actually enables one LFP looks cleaner.
2	1	York, please use TAB in each line following the coreboot coding standard.
1	1	I don't like either style. Don't like c here. I can change it if it helps to get this pulled.
1	1	See my other patch http://review.coreboot.org/7856 (work in progress and doesn't contain cleanups for this particular file, but it deprecates print_debug alltogether except for the two new boards that can't do CAR)
1	1	I will do this for all remaining get_top_of_ram() in one go, separate from this fam10 patch.
1	2	Having nightmares about empty lines kidnapping you in an alien ship and performing colonoscopy?
1	1	You called out the registers being 4 bytes wide but didn't mention each signal has 2 bits for its state.
2	1	So those need to be enabled on as as-needed basis. Kconfig knows about SSE and its ilk. Noted, will take care of it.
1	1	And #include AGESA headers in a public coreboot header? Are you out of your mind?
3	1	I see. I can probably help you with that. I would like to assert that if HAVE_USBDEBUG is available the chipset and/or mainboard does the setup in bootblock to get things at least halfway working. That or so early in romstage it is before console. I think that is a good goal to have.
1	1	uint32_t as above.

Also if you could format the comments with /* .. */ style would put ice on the cake.
1	3	yeah, if it's fatal, we might as well just revert the serial patch.  The whole purpose of the serial (or ehci-debug) route is for platforms that don't support (for whatever reason) cbmem console log.  If it's fatal here, then the script won't run on those platforms, making it impossible to collect the logs with this script.
I'm not going to fight it anymore though.
1	1	Make sure the smbus code is compiled and linked in.
1	1	where do these section come from - the linker feeling clever?
1	1	They could probably be combined, but the speed would be the same.  We still need to write the address out first before we can auto-increment. Let's leave that to later when/if it gets moved to the southbridge wrapper
2	1	The coding style puts spaces around the `<<`. Could you add these please?
2	1	Separate patch and please use a tab for consistency. A separate patch could unify that too I guess.
3	1	That was actually the original code. If dest <= src and you're only copying one byte at a time, if you start from the top you'll never overwrite the data you haven't copied yet. Otherwise, you have to start from the other end. *dest++ = *src memcpy;, but memcpy is not *dest++ = *src;.

To quote from the pretty short man page:

The memory areas must not overlap.

That's the difference between memcpy and memmove. If there was no overlap at all (which we could check for) then you could use memcpy, and that would make the normal case work like it always has.

But I'm working on a change to add optimized versions of memmove for x86 and ARM. In order to test them I'm going to implement them in the chromeos tree, and then to transfer them over I've put together a big series of patches to upstream so they should just apply.
1	1	This isn't C. Stop comparing it with C. What you are doing here with the brightness is just redefining the same thing. Both boards you touched have the same definitions for the brightness, DSPC.BRTU and DSPC.BRTD, so it makes limited sense to redefine them as something interim.
2	1	Please see here: http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/6192/11/src/northbridge/intel/i945/acpi.c 

dev = dev_find_device(0x8086, 0x27a0, 0);
        if (!dev)
                dev = dev_find_device(0x8086, 0x2770, 0);
        if (!dev)
                return current;
2	1	I will add a general error value and use it in this case.
1	1	I still can't decide whether this belongs here or in superio/winbond/w83627hf/w83627hf.h ...

This applies to every romstage.c in this changeset.
1	1	Shouldn't the caller be informed? If not, the whole crc check is for debugging only.
1	1	The general way to do this is $(TOP)/src/southbridge etc. etc.
1	1	All macros in southbridge.h are Vortex86EX PCI S/B config register offsets. They are all fixed for Vortex86EX CPU.
3	1	How many sockets on this board? It's really best to stop using this setting, as it makes no sense. Coreboot will adapt if only one CPU is loaded. But why limit a given build for a board to one CPU? Any reason?
2	1	Same remark here. Please write here why this routine does it.
1	2	The user might still want to disable it...

Unlike the other options, this one does not need a pirq_table.c or mptable.c file be sitting around...

Generally dropping these tables from the build is almost never worth it, since most OSes expect something there.
1	2	No. I must have missed it while removing things. I'll update the patch to nix this.
1	1	Only if using FSP is enabled. otherwise: build failure
1	2	TableID is specified to be 8 characters. While the original version broke that by adding a space, I guess it's simply ignored. With this change, the final ""M"" would be dropped, too.

(When you fix that, also cut OEMID to 4 characters, it's 32bit. ACPI5.0 19.5.28)
1	1	Can the selection of the common part be moved one level higher until a Fintek chip comes along which is different? No idea if that is possible in Kconfig.
2	2	You have a potential problem here with MMCONF_SUPPORT. This option indicates hardware has PCI-e config register access in MMIO space in addition to the legacy 0xcf8/0xcfc IO registers.

A second option MMCONF_SUPPORT_DEFAULT is not set, so by default you would use PCI IO config access. But since those are non-atomic, SMI handler in i82801ix explicitly uses MMIO and you have no MMCONF_BASE_ADDRESS set.
1	1	That comment came from U-Boot... I'm not sure what it implies. I guess we should leave it for the sake of consistency, at least for now?
1	1	'*' next to struct name not type. Also, you don't need to use CamelCaseJustBecauseTheCodeWhereItSUsedUsesIt.

 see_what_i_mean ? yes : no;
1	2	follow up? hate all this stuff getting bikeshed for weeks for that sort of thing.

can you also check out 6465, 6463.
2	4	Please add the tab. It??ª?s sad that the latest clean up patches for the Butterfly were not adapted.
1	2	...except for the fact that get_initial_timestamp() doesn't exist for Fam10h, and implementation looks non-trivial.
1	1	What about abstracting this even further: instead of requiring a region_device to describe the location, we could just accept the name of an FMAP region and look up its offset and size.
1	2	The problem I was referring to is that the name of the constants is quite long, and fitting them all on the same line, you risk breaking the 80 character line limit (we use that so we can fit several files side-by-side on the same screen). Though you can use tagged initialization, and break it up over several lines, as I've demonstrated above -- also makes things more readable, and reduces the chance of mixing up the order.
2	2	Yes, sorry about missing the indirection. Here's the example.

0xffc00000 -- 0xffe00000 cbfs in memory.
0xffdffffc has 0xffdfffa0 in it which would then be passed back to map.
1	1	Reading this again, I realize: nothing. We want the two most significant bits and get them either way.
2	2	Please don't declare symbols weak. Provide weak definitions.
4	2	I don't always agree with Paul, but when I do, I'm either drunk or I have a very good reason.
1	1	s/the//

??ª?? rebase the FSP with Intel??ª?s tool BCT.
1	1	i assume that the reason that the  copyright is updated now is because the file was updated in 2011, but the copyright wasn't.
1	3	So in the end, you don't even need the AGESA struct. You might think that casting to a struct makes the code more readable, but in this case, it also hides nasty bugs.
1	1	dev_find_slot() explicitly returns a 0 (yeah, it's the same as a NULL).  Maybe that should be changed to return a NULL, but at this point, I think checking for 0 is reasonable.

yes, if it's 0, we still reach the code.  I've changed it to not dereference it before checking it though.
2	2	Removing onboard devices instead of setting them to off can break the chipset configuration. This is the entire reason for this stuff to be in a devicetree.cb and to make the static.c to point to the correct setup functions. These devices are always on the board and the chip configuration will enable and disable (and hide) them based on the platform configuration and the device tree.  Without this, everything would be a normal pci device enumeration and coreboot would be much much simpler... 

I also agree with Martin that, as a reference design, it is important to show the configuration as clearly as possible.
1	2	Factor that out into a function(?) `print_fail_message` in a follow-up/preceding patch?

    test ??ª?? && print_fail_message(path)

as

    test ??ª?? && print_fail_message(""${IASL_DIR}/source/compiler"")
1	1	Ahh yes. OK. ROMCC and all that. I forgot about that jazz. On further thought w.r.t. the naming. It should really be pcidev_t, no? That would be typedef'd to unsigned int *and* used in struct pci_path? That name would be clearer. Or are we doing to try and encode all different types of devices into a simple_device_t?
2	2	Ok, I found an abandoned change in Gerrit from Ky???sti [2], where Stefan commented this.

???¯On ich7 / i945 pmbase is already set in romstage... Please drop #if 0 code...???®

Guess that justifies a comment so it is clear when comparing `lpc.c` from different PCHs.

[2] http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/302/8/src/southbridge/intel/i82801gx/lpc.c
1	1	if that's a uintptr_t, then you again don't need this double cast.
1	2	Are these redundant copies of those in arch-agnostic lib/romstage.ld ?
2	1	I'd prefer if sizeof(x) was used throughout, instead of sizeof(op_t). As a bonus, op_t would only occur once (in the variable declaration) and then the typedef could easily be removed.
1	1	well, it's not really now... here... but that's okay
1	1	Don't set the `idx_type` for now, as it may also contain internal errors (I would leave the code path in couchdb for dealing with it though, so that I can add it later.
2	2	what means ""error_expected"" = ""create"". It's means there are nor error? then it's better to use None by default for self.input.param(""error-expected"", None)

and you set string in error_expected by default value is boolean. python allows it but it's not good to change the type of variable
2	1	What status is the best here? I cannot use status from the current response here,  also I don't know status of the other responses here.
3	1	Interesting. The ruby client have similar feature, but it  doesn't touch the packet (the user should explicitly specify which conversion he'd like to apply to value). I think your solution is good enough. Is it possible to generalize such flag so that I can mark the keys as 'marshalled'. But such generalization won't be portable between clients because all of them use different formats.

Another good feature which is connected to value formats is flag which will says that the value is a valid document (json hash) because in this case the client could decide to map it to some high-level object
2	1	No!! More sleeps!! I think we're up to 22 seconds now!
1	1	now the test doesn't install SG at all. it will fall on the first run if SG is already installed on vm.
1	1	Currently, bucket name cannot contain symbols from html. That is why I remove escaping.
2	1	Please add more functional/features tests on this conf file when you add the rest of the code.
1	1	Just to be clear. The projector does not dictate the port number of the end point.  During handshake, the indexer or coordinator tells the projector the endpoint.
1	1	Okay, then we will keep them in an engine stats request.
1	1	I want the next item to be dequeued when the previously dequeued item has been consumed by the caller (as there is no facility to enqueue an item again). So I am using the unbuffered channel for this synchronization.
1	1	You shouldn't need this - I have a patch in flight to our gtest - see https://github.com/daverigby/gtest/tree/clang_analyzer which will make the GTest asset macros ""understood"" by clang analyser.
1	2	My point is that let's maintain our own configs even fi they are the same as the default ones, and change them soon by considering various factors including perf results.
1	1	You need to do error detection etc.. Perhaps its easier to just build up a single buffer, and then call a single function to write everything to disk so that you have a single place to add file IO error detection (and logging).
2	1	Our convention here is to have URL like this:

/node/controller/reloadCertificate
1	2	Just a suggestion: May be we can pass both channels as arguments ?
2	1	I think the per stream flow control won't be implemented. Please double check with Mike and remove this code in case it won't be implemented (and update/get the spec updated).
1	2	do you need to expose this at all operation base level? since just the mutations will ever have it.
1	1	(btw. this field will occupy 7 bytes for our 64 bit builds no matter what due to alignment for the next variable)
1	2	every bucket needs to have its own gen to avoid sharing updates/deletes with other buckets.
1	1	obviously. but in future patches.

there is general convention regarding order of import statements:

1. standard library imports

2. related third party imports

3. local application/library specific imports

eventually we will follow this rule.
2	2	I think it is probably cleaner to put CAS change in the caller rather than del() here.  The caller knows it is a normal deletion or delWithMeta(). The del() here is a generic function and should not take care of CAS issues. 

Also, is it better to get a brand new CAS here? What is the point to increment the CAS for a normal deletion? CAS is a token, it is not meant to be incremented/decremented. We grab a new CAS for other operations, seems not quite consistent to me to increment it here.
3	1	sounds good. will update once the dependence:
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/33453/ is merged.
1	2	Agree, (it was not added as part of this patch, but I'll fix it). Hopefully we'll be able to completely get rid of these parameters...
1	1	increment out is extra here, you can use num_rebalance everywhere
2	2	Sorry. I did not closely looked into log date part. Thanks for this patch
1	1	I think it is better to pass AccessScanner reference to the constructor instead of checking NULL here.
2	1	If you look at the previous version of the code we returned true if the new one didn't contain ""engine""

I just noticed that I need to nuke out the engine params from setting :D
1	2	This is not following the style for the other source files
1	1	Non-standard ports (And other more exotic configs) now have their own section that I've added in this commit
1	1	started implementing the test with existing key, then acquiring relevant byte[ ], to be continued
1	3	but, that is supposed to be there. I think it's confusing having some functions being vbucket_* and some others being lcbvb_* -- so that's why the comment is there, so I can fix this up at a later commit. Let me do that right now actually.. http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/CCBC-431
2	1	In this case, we only need to set it (item->old_offset) to zero, because _wal_flush_cmp() function compares 'item->offset' instead when 'it->old_offset' is zero. Thanks.
2	2	Most of the spring stuff looks like it can be found in the default m2 repo. Why do we need this? Also, milestone is wrong here.
1	1	Shouldn't the URL changed to couchbase.com as well.
I see this in few other places as well.
1	1	sizeof("""") includes the trailing '0'. Couple more of this
2	1	We also need to check the return value from wal_commit as well.
2	4	fix for the following panic

panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

1	1	why can we remove these? has this issue been fixed by ep-engine?
1	2	in the first if (if ok)  we are updating, so curSize does not change. 
in the else, if we are cleaning one entry before inserting, curSize does not change (delete is guaranteed to remove one, insert will not error), otherwise if we are not cleaning up one entry, it's a straight add, and curSize is incremented at line 92.

The removed atomic inc was mistakenly left over from when add didn't have an update
1	1	Don't invoke callback from within the entry point. IMO it's better to throw an exception here for now. Can you just schedule a callback via a timer so it doesn't fire immediately from this function?
1	2	Okay, I understand what you're trying to do here. My concern is that we change the state from BACKFILL to IN_MEMORY even if there are backfill items in the queue or unAcked items in the ACK queue that we will implement soon. This will cause some confusions in debugging, showing stats in UI, etc. Let's add this to the to-do list and address it as a separate commit.
1	1	Might be better to move this test to right after the docio_read_doc_key_meta call, since it's doing the error handling for it. If there was an error, there's no point in populating 'doc' and '*doc_offset', right?
1	2	The problem might be if you're running cmake outside ""git"" repository (dist package)?
1	1	Style: Given totalCount is guaranteed to be zero here, just return zero - it's clearer to the reader what's being returned.
1	1	These are wrapper functions, and will use in test cases directly.
2	1	Please add the comment to say that new_filename will be ignored in the auto compaction mode.
2	2	This is hack for rdoc. This comment forces to treat it as read-only attribute
2	1	A similar comment should appear in the man pages for now, right?

nitpick: It's better (more professional) to write these things in the 3rd person.  For instance ""It will be made smarter later"" rather than ""I'm not going to try to make it smarter"".
1	1	why use -100? from the code below, it seems you meant -1 here.
1	1	Yes, but it will change the output of EXPLAIN, so need to coordinate checkin with QE.
1	2	can we avoid json_dump here , we are doing it few times in query generator. return the json format
3	1	if we assume that initCache() always succeeds - otherwise service constructor fails - we do not need to check for non-nil cache or return error for it anywhere
1	1	There may be a minor bug here in that there can be a TMPFAIL at authentication time.  This doesn't seem to handle that.
1	1	How is 'bbox' supposed to be encoded for transmission over http?  Currently its encoded as a Javascript array, which is probably why its not behaving as expected.
2	1	I believe you can only have one appender configured. The file based one is more useful to me, but maybe not to others.
1	1	I'd expect that to autounbox.  Autounboxing *might* be less efficient, but it's more readable and won't matter much for a test.
1	3	this is confusing. I think this needs to be called PluggablePrefix or something of that nature. To call it Service is confusing to me.
1	2	this beforeTest block is used all over the place in the tests, we just try to get it to a clean state.. its slow but it works :/
1	1	Empty space should be removed per previous comment.
1	1	if in some places function returns something then it should return always something
1	1	You shouldn't check ""_doc.length.bodylen == 0 && (iterator->opt & FDB_ITR_NO_DELETES)"" again because we already checked it above.
2	1	Then shared_pointer is probably the way to go (if you're happy with the cost of refcounting them).
1	1	We should not reset the current filter here, but still need to use it for incoming read operations, and then replace it with the new filter in an atomic way below.
1	3	I personally hate this! commands should not go to a redirected file.
I think your redirect options should be off, on, verbose - and only verbose should add commands
1	1	yeah.. that being said, the protocol explicitly state it to be two bytes ;-)
1	1	skip_rebalance option is not needed here, it is always skipped unless nodes_init is provided
why do you skip_cleanup?
1	1	This can't guarantee there won't be two pipeline running concurrently for one replication.
1	1	You can actually remove this entirely - I needed it to work around a bug in lcb when connecting to a non-standard port (i.e. ./cluster_run running on port 9000 instead of 8091). For use in perfrunner with standard packages we probably want CCCP.
3	3	Good idea. Although I could now just have a single stat and remove scrubber:status? If we have a stat called scrubber:runs we can infer the status.

Is there a policy though of maintaining stats? any external tools reliant upon them that would be unhappy with removal of a stat?
2	1	there should be

  } else {
    rv = get_env_plugin_info(pi);

In this case the lcb_cntl user will get correct effective type
4	1	This isn't a very good function name.. (I assume that it doesn't initialize everything in memcached).. init_allocation_hooks() would probably be a better name..
1	1	Could you also update RELEASE_NOTES.markdown in the project root. You are adding interfaces, it would be great to document them there.
1	1	Instead of cast twice notifier to EObject, you could use a variable.
2	1	Please add 2015 here:
Copyright (c) 2007, 2015 IBM Corporation and others.
1	1	s/should the callee read/should the callee expect me to read/, I mean.
1	1	""Sort by Name"", ""Sort by ID"", ""Sort by Time""?

Strange to test that as it has no effect on the time selection, and no effect on the tree if there is only one trace and only one thread.
1	1	According to https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#Plug-ins_with_no_API, its bundle version should be evolved along with its host plug-in i.e. org.eclipse.jdt.ui, which will become 3.11.2 now. Hence, I updated the same for the test bundle. I will upload a new patch set with 3.10.101.
2	1	Please use org.eclipse.emf.compare.internal.utils.ComparisonUtil.isDeleteOrUnsetDiff(candidate) instead to also get the intended behavior for multi-valued attributes and unsets.
1	1	Unfortunately, I don't think so, since it probably contains the version of the metamodel which varies over time...
2	1	... we need to add a special check to make sure the last model bucket is counted in the last scaled index without going out of bounds.
1	2	I started with standard ReentrantLocks here, but when adding the lookFor...() method, I realized that that is a read-only operation, so concurrent queries didn't need to block each other.
1	2	Shift + left click or drag to extend T1 of a current range always changes T1 to T2 (and T2 to T1)
1	1	I'm not enough of a regex guru, but there is probably a way to merge all these matchers into one regex, so that we don't have to check all the patterns one by one over the same string.
1	2	Create static BugzillaRestCreateTaskSchema.getFieldNameFromAttributeName() and add an ImmutableMap
1	1	I think we should hardcode the status since the user can only subscribe.
2	2	Adding to Megumi's nit: Consider initializing the value to true, and possibly collapsing these two methods down to one with an argument
2	1	TTo be more complete, check for funcService != null first (or use an optional?)
2	3	This method looks really strange, it seems to allow to get or create a view model context at the same time. The parameter set is confusing. It is not part of this review, but please add a BR to discuss this separatly
3	1	Why do you set the value to true for the requiresAuthentication here since it is already set when you create the class !
2	1	Don't think this is really needed. See comments in PartialStateSystem.

Also, protected fields, no no!
1	2	you handle all these exceptions in the same way so you can use multi-catch:

 } catch (RevisionSyntaxException | AmbiguousObjectException | IncorrectObjectTypeException | IOException e) {
1	2	I think the copyright is ""Eike Stepper (Berlin, Germany) and others.""
3	1	The super.compareTo() below will do this null check, you don't need to repeat it.
1	1	using ANY_DIFF has a huge impact on performance, typically there are many thousands of unchanged objects and only a few changed, with ANY_DIFF filter you will only traverse the changed objects otherwise all of them
1	1	I'd add a guard to prevent surprises

 if (db.isBare()) {
     return null;
 }
1	1	Yhis could be removed and use as parameter of the reset method.
2	1	Yes, assuming the modelService works :)  This private method does not rely on other services.  Also, model service may have issues with elements that have the same ID.  In theory I could put the same element with the same id multiple times in a menu.  I don't know if modelService would be able to resolve that.  At least here we can count and validate if need be.

I will make the other changes and await response on this.
1	1	It was OK in my mind to not fix ResourcesViewTest but at least help ControlFlowViewTest and ControlFlowViewFiltering.

But I try getExpandedElementCount instead.

We can't check the exact count because it can change, see
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/65024/
2	2	I can think about a lot of other tests. 
E.g: ""[*]"", ""[2]"", [EXACT], [7..UPPER], [LOWER..54], [LOWER..*]
Also bad cases: [*..*], [*..UPPER] which all are possible when we allow any literal at any of the places
What about non-literal specs? can we at least ensure it does not fail for somethig like OpaqueExpression. 
What if there are no valueSpec? What is shown for the MultiplicityElement without any setXXX, just after creation
1	1	The cache element2ViewMap is no longer used in this solution. Have you measure the impact?

The replace code is not exactly the same (this was not duplicated code), are you sure to do the same thing?
1	2	It's a mistake, I have take release of org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.outline package instead of org.eclipse.sirius.editor.tools.internal.outline one.
1	1	These two variables were defined separately in the previous version. Now that you need them in every method, you could just declare them at the first utilization (applies to the other methods too).
1	1	Same question: Do you want me to declare the RevTree variables before?
1	1	Not a fan of createpopupmenu, it's huge and hard to read. 

reset columns I will do. I can be convinced of using cpm too.
1	1	not a big thing but sequence number should have been bumped
2	2	I think you miss the (complicated) case of a conflmict between a move in a branch vs a uncontrolling in another branch => In which case there is a deletion compared to origin on one side, and a rename on the other side.
1	2	Find a way to create the logger elsewhere, because we cannot specify in this configuration file a path where the user is allowed to write.
By default, the file will be in the current eclipse install folder, but as Max pointed out, many users ahve eclipse installed in a folder where they're not allowed to write...
1	1	Then maybe the loop can be inside this method, it would be more consistent with the fact that 'Starts' is plural...
2	2	Is omitting other kinds of completion proposals on a specific purpose, or just a way to keep the patch small (and you currently don't need more)?
This kinda contradicts the use of the general type Binding (rather than MethodBinding) - looks like you couldn't make up your mind ....
1	1	The director wasn't being accessed here, but in getSubstitutionsPaths() which had such a check. I duplicated the check as it makes it more obvious.
1	2	don't use hard coded type names:
link.isOfType(CoreRelationTypes.Default_Hierarchical__Child)
1	1	to forget too..

Specific code for containers 1 and 2 edit parts
1	1	need to
assumeTrue(cygProfile.exists());
when the trace is not present
1	1	Well, if your PATH is empty, I think the split by separator might end up passing null as the candidatePath.
1	1	strange parameter name ... I suppose it was late when you added it ;-)
1	1	This can probably be removed if the suggestions for performOk and performApply are implemented.
2	2	Is this a typo? I think there is no underscore there:
gdk_screen_get_monitor_workarea ()

https://developer.gnome.org/gdk3/stable/GdkScreen.html#gdk-screen-get-monitor-workarea

Also, for dynamic functions, you need to add an entry to os_custom.h

Please see: http://leoufimtsev.github.io./org/swt-dev.html#sec-9-2
1	2	False is the default, so I suggest we remove it.  I've never seen it used before and it just made me scratch my head as to what it was for.
1	1	From what I can gather, AsciiDoc should be camel-case http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc
1	1	I think somebody just chose to put the AllTests class in a separate package from the other test classes.  I don't know why.  But they aren't integration-style tests; they seem to be closer to unit-style.
1	2	Sorry, I mean paintLine(createDisplayString(line), line, y, lineHeight, gc, display);
2	3	Done
According to the doc Repository#resolve(String) will throw a MissingObjectException.
I decided to wrap it into a WrongGitFlowStateException because an empty repository is not something you would normally operate on with git flow.
2	1	I like this test case because it is more realistic than the expression above. But then, I'd prefer that we remove the other one.
1	2	Is it possible that this is related to the Critical path view? Patrick said he saw a weird bug with time alignment being off because of the critical path.
1	1	Add spaces to relation name to match those in type definition
2	1	not sure whether this is needed but it's not harmful. We will get the NPE when (oldHeadId!=null && oldHeadLog==null). But if you look at line 724 this will not be the case. Anyhow: +1
3	1	If we have a class hierarchy with one base class and many subclasses, in most cases it works well to have one base test classes and extended test classes, for each implementation. That way tests that apply to all implementations can go in the base class (and will be run for each sub-test).

The ""state system tests"" in lttng2.kernel.tests are like this, and it works very well. Ideally these should be brought back in statesystem.core.tests. InMemoryBackendTest is a good start, but it should split the tests that are common to all backends in a base class.

In any case, Backend tests would be great, but it would really be something separate from this patch.
2	1	I guess I don't need to understand why one is better than the other :)
1	1	this should be done without open/close of the editor. Just by checking the mapping
1	2	The IDE feature does not provide any team dependent plug-ins any longer but it makes sense to keep the dependency. I didn't realize that team.ui contributed a bunch of functionality that doesn't necessarily require a Mylyn team extension.
1	1	I had to read twice before to know what is affected in variable. Sometimes, make complete writing is simpler to understand than ternary operator.
1	1	This file now has Windows line endings.

@Jan: Could you verify that you have core.autocrlf=input configured in your Tycho repository clone?
2	1	no, I'd like to keep the API of this class close to ObjectId
1	1	Would it make it easier to override if we return a List?  That way if someone wants to add an adapter, they could simply add to the list instead of copying the array.

This method is used in an enhanced for loop, so a list would work just as well as an Array
1	1	Those variables are used by everyone deriving from GerritCommand. It should be pushed up as well and the getter/setters
1	1	not if you want to compare from a raw byte array used to serialize object IDs
2	1	this rather looks like an IllegalArgumentException

looks like we should check this earlier when setURI is called and already fail there if a URI is already set
1	2	This doesn't work properly when the index is negative (e.g. time is before the offset).
2	2	Done
Yes it does. This kind of test aimes at checking the resolution of existing namespaces. I actually did not think about nested namespaces with the same name might be a problem when creating new namespaces in the source. I've added a test for being sure.
1	1	Why define this as a new function instead of replacing the one that expects a NamedElement? getFuncName is invoked on actions, but also on guards, and we need to apply the new naming on guards as well.

If we replace the old getFuncName with this one, but keeping the NamedElement parameter, we can move the ""translator.getSource"" part here and be able to reuse the same function without modifying the ActionDeclarationGenerator or the GuardDeclarationGenerator.
2	1	Removed the !commentPopupDialog.getEditable() check
2	1	Closing of the shell is probably the best time to save its size. Other settings can be saved at the same time too.
1	2	This is the simplest way to make it build. The complicated way would be to change doBeforeTest so it throws a Throwable instead of an Exception.
1	1	Addressed by a separate change through https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/44706
1	1	question for me: every time, I ask me when we need to put [1.2.0,)
why we do not use it?
2	1	compareTo on strings! Need to use version comparator, I just added comment so it will get fixed
1	1	Applied @NonNullByDefault everywhere it was possible
2	2	Call getResource() with false for the parameter loadOnDemand instead of true to be lazy ?
1	1	Should be ImagePath DataType
Don't forget te regenerate the metamodel
2	1	Please look at https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/Contributor_Guide#Checking_for_JGit_API_Changes_using_API_Baseline

I suggest you setup API checks. They give a lot of warnings here about missing @since tags etc.
1	2	This is a refactoring from my side that sneaked in when I split the commit. I'll revert this asap since it adds nothing to this change.
1	1	setting input to '-' isn't supported on Mac hence these tests fail with the error message ""sed: -: No such file or directory"". AFAIK if no input is given sed defaults to read the standard input on Mac and Linux

more occurrences below
2	1	do we need to take care all of this, if we decide not to put them in 2.0 ?
2	1	Oh I'm all for small tests ;)  But here we need data in the queue to flush it, and data to be present to take() it. So they kind of need to be done in sequence.
2	2	There is no point in defining those private static variables, we could just use the string literal directly in the methods. It was like that originally because the original definitions were public static final's. We then switched to methods so that they could be overriden.
2	1	This code, RefreshLabelImageJob and PermissionAuthoritySessionManagerListener could be encapsulated in a single class whose responsability is to manage lock decorations update. And this class could be named LockDecorationUpdater, like that this class could be reused for potential others views.
1	1	The same strange *.wdt.* package
Should it be 'wst'?
1	2	What happen when you pass the same email and ask to delete it and set as preferred? Make it sense to check for this and reject this case as mutually exclusive options?
2	1	If I understand this right the buildr process is able to load Java classes dynamically and invoke them with reflection? That does it make it slightly easier to do some complex steps.
3	2	I think that this class makes more sense than the Branch class because there are several places in Gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using Branch objects.  Jgit does define some of those constants, but we cannot use jgit everywhere, particularly in GWT, which I suspect is why this class is here in the first place.  We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants, and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it isn't only about refs, but rather refs and projects).  These constants feel  more appropriate here to me than in the Branch class.  I have some more changes, which I will push, which move them out of the Branch class completely.  I am willing to update the comment here if need be, but this class feels appropriate to me (based on its name and location) and I don't think that ""naive"" comment should get in the way of that.
1	1	This should be just 'Authentication required' to make the message consistent with other REST endpoints.
1	2	Put all of this into a static helper method that returns a Map<String,String> already configured for the Sun JNDI names used below. Then we only need a map for connection pooling as an instance member.
2	2	I'd rather do the logging fix separately, and not in 2.9.2

To avoid the potential to miss any warnings, we can add a warning in the 2.9.2 release note to not run the upgrade in batch mode.
1	1	commit.hashCode() should be sufficient. A commit can only have one author.
1	1	The refreshing of the mergeable state is already implemented in MergeOp.verifyMergeability(Change). I would prefer to have the code only in one place.
1	1	Not applicable given the above but FYI: I would just use com.google.common.base.Predicate for this.
1	1	This should now depend on a python_library() that contains tools/gerrit/api.py.
2	2	Seems like it doesn't need to be static, it only used in Schema_82 and is not static. I guess the answer is to be consistent with newStatement() below?
2	2	After seeing this live on gerrit-review, I think this is noisy. Every change seems to have 10+ conflicting changes, which I think is just an artifact of there being lots of old, unlikely-to-merge but still open changes in the project.

I would prefer something like including ""-age:30d"" and/or ""limit:5"" with a link to the full search without that restriction.
1	1	This doesn't exactly match what we generate for initially visible lines.  For those we specify the html directly and use
 <tr valign=""top"">

This will output slightly differently for the expanded lines
 <tr style=""vertical-align: top; "">

I don't believe there is a way to set the valign property with the gwt flextable.
2	2	FYI this probably doesn't always work. Booleans are stored as CHAR(1) with value Y for true and N for false. Not every JDBC driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value. It would be safer to use ""Y"".equals(rs.getString()) in code such as this.

Can't this statement also be written as an UPDATE:

  UPDATE accounts SET reverse_patch_set_order = 'Y'
  WHERE display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order = 'Y';

  UPDATE accounts SET show_username_in_review_category = 'Y'
  WHERE display_person_name_in_review_category = 'Y';

This should be much faster to process, and every SQL server we support will grok those two small statements. And it avoids the problem with boolean conversion.
2	2	Resolved. I managed to drop this type altogether, so the name of the method is moot.
3	1	The documentation here is pretty much the same, but the errors occur in different circumstances.
2	1	Nope, forgot to cherry-pick that one. Thanks for noticing, fixed.
1	2	nit: I think this comment is sort of redundant with the code.
1	3	Confusing? raw formatter, RawText helper class and raw var name? Rename var say to bytes?
2	2	Please don't do that. We manipulate DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisProvider to achieve what you want. Check ChangeEditIT for example: [1], Methods annotated with @Before and @After.

* [1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/master/gerrit-acceptance-tests/src/
  test/java/com/google/gerrit/acceptance/edit/ChangeEditIT.java#116
1	2	FindBugs is complaining about these parameters being null.
1	1	Unnecessary field if sshdAddress is used consistently.
2	2	I assumed you didn't care about modifying the caller's array because ""resources += srcs"" modifies resources in-place as well. Yay Python. So you should fix that below.

Also typically in Python we strongly discourage mutable default arugments.
2	1	We backed away from that. It is simply impractical. Too many tools and users use refs/for/ to remove support for it.
1	1	You might want to use a constant ScriptRunner.NOP instead.
1	2	according to [1] signature relevant files are 
 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
 META-INF/*.SF
 META-INF/*.DSA
 META-INF/*.RSA
 META-INF/SIG-*
so depending on the signing algorithm used you may have to also exclude
 META-INF/*.DSA
 META-INF/SIG-*

[1] http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Signed_JAR_File
3	2	Change looks fine, but please fix up this bad rebase.
1	1	Use `'$site_path'/hooks` style here.  The rest of the documentation call is $site_path, not $sitepath, and the '' around $site_path will make it stand out from the /hooks part, while the `` overall will make it show up in a different type face.
2	2	Sanitize non negative values? If someone missed time units, providing just 30 instead of 30s then the scheduler is going to be invoked every 30 ms.
1	1	> So at very least you should only check/parse patch set part, if ref starts with REFS_CHANGES, if at all.

It already does this, startIndex checks for the prefix.
2	1	I would have put all this in a separate config file like we do in the other plugins.
2	1	nit: seems like this should cause a 400 (not a 404). Are you able to differentiate valid syntax?
1	2	My Nit Pref: eliminate if, just return the boolean evaluation.
1	2	Either we have MetaDataUpdate that is batch-oriented or we don't. It doesn't make any sense to change the batch behavior for the same instance after it was created. Ever. So, drop that setter and add second assisted inject constructor that accepts BatchRefUpdate parameter instead (and make the batch field final as pointed out above).
1	1	I think this might be easier to read (despite the duplicate code) as:

 if (isEditModeEnabled(info, rev)) {
   editMode.setVisible(...);
   addFile...
   reviewMode...
   editFileAction...
 } else {
   editMode.setVisible(false);
   addFile...
   reviewMode...
 }

But I don't feel strongly.
2	2	I would love to do this. The problem is that all SSH information is only available inside of the SSH project and the server project which implements the REST endpoints doesn't have a dependency on it. Since we don't want this dependency I don't know how to implement it.

On the other hand, if you have SSH enabled and you are interested in the SSH summary and connections you can retrieve this information via SSH. The REST endpoints are mainly important for installations where SSH is not available, but in this case there is also no SSH summary and no SSH connections. This is why I'm okay with the current solution of ignoring the SSH stuff in the REST endpoint.
1	1	c.patchSetId isn't automatically populated.  You need to ensure its filled in yourself, unless you use the one that is already parsed and computed during validateChangeList() and stored inside of the commits map.
2	2	I don't think config can be null.

So now you can drop the method. :-)
1	1	The CherryPick RESTApi acts on revisions (e.g. patchsets), not Changes. Just like the review RestApi does. Hence I don't think that it should go into ChangeApi. Look at the REST-url, and you will see it differs quite from the other RESTFul commands in ChangeApi. If you still want me to add it to ChangeApi, I can do that. But this is how I reasoned about where to put it.
1	1	Well, this is still a parameter, so you should probably leave the line.
2	1	I don't think there is an easy way to do this, but it feels like these error messages should be shared with the ones from the WUI (ApprovalTable).
2	2	Maybe TestChanges? 

*I prefer FooBar over BarForFoo
*""Util"" is redundant with the package name
*TestFoo says ""implementation (e.g. fake) of Foo for tests"" while TestFoos says ""static methods for dealing with Foos""

It's not super compelling, but hey, at least it's shorter.
1	1	I will then await your next patch set before continuing review of this (and follow-up) changes.
3	2	On HTTP /abandon and /restore accept no body. This results in null being passed to the apply() method, which handles it gracefully by creating an empty input.

I think its common to call /abandon and /restore with no input. Your tests are certainly showing that. Perhaps we should overload abandon() and restore() methods to also have a no-arg form that passes null to apply the same way the HTTP interface does when the client doesn't supply a body.
1	1	line wrap before throws so the line isn't over 80 columns
1	1	Ah, I think this is from sometime before when I had it  actually raising an error...In fact I think in one of the later changes I changed my mind and went back to throwing, but I guess we'll get to that later.
1	1	This API method isn't covered by unit test. Add a test for it or add a TODO that unit test is still missing.
1	1	Yes, because otherwise it is lost, as isBase64() creates a new instance of BinaryResult.
1	1	[optionally] extend SSH based acceptance test too:

 acceptance/ssh/GarbageCollectionIT.java
1	1	> The bug that I reported was actually on the change screen; I had not observed the same issue on the project page.

Yep, the original fix was to fix the project page. It'd be great if we could fix both in one go.
1	1	I don't think it needs to be set, which means it doesn't need to be in the input.
2	2	I was speaking in a more general sense to explain myself here. You cannot have a variable 'foo-bar' in say java or C, because the language is defined to interpret that as 2 literals, one subtracted from the other (you usually put white spaces and surroundings like ""x = foo - bar;"".

This is why I was abstaining from the ""-"" character in my own
topic names for some time now as my unconsciousness tells me a topic in gerrit is similar to a variable name in a programming language. 

Of course I do know ""-"" can be part of the topic in Gerrit, I am not just used to it.
3	1	Add "": "" after ""successful"" otherwise the detail message will be appended directly onto it without any space.
1	2	Long line. Either break into multiple lines or add a static import.
2	1	I'm not clear if ""${workspace_loc:gitiles-parent}"" mean ""$WORKSPACE/gitiles-parent"" or if it means ""Path to the project named ""gitiles-parent"".

When I changed the on-disk location (via the rename above) of my gitiles checkout (under my /src/workspaces directory) to /src/workspaces/gitiles-parent then I got to the next error. :)
1	1	Why is this rounding necessary? Just a guess, clock skew?
1	1	Ok, I've changed the method name to 'validate'. Not sure though if it's worth the effort to change the already existing listeners.
2	1	Because they need some more tweaking to supports booth modes: standalone and in tree?
2	1	Be consistent about inner class references. Here you use Metadata but above you use SecureStoreLoadUtil.Metadata. In this case I am OK with either form in the class but want them to be consistent within the ~60 lines of code you have.
1	1	Docs in master are built from Buck. This Makefile should have been removed when the pom.xmls were removed.
4	1	Good call!  New code uses work_git.rev_parse('HEAD').  PTAL.
1	1	Change this to throw CompileException instead. Elsewhere on failure you throw IOException or CompileException.
2	1	Don't encode the value right away.  Instead we should lazily encode the value only when the serialization stream needs it.  Thus the constructor is just:

  this.object = object;
  this.codec = codec;
  this.hash = object.hashCode();
1	1	I think they are trying to match with the access control section data, which uses local because it used to also have the inherited rules from parent projects, and the local rules were in their own collection so the UI could tell them apart.
1	2	I will take my share of the blame here. We don't need equals or hashCode at all, they come for free from StringKey, and I added them for no reason way back in I5df6f0c5.

And nothing personal, Sven, you know how it is when you've spent all afternoon debugging such a mysterious bug in production.
2	1	No it doesn't. We just have to parse repo-hooks childNodes after the project childNodes. Which you already do above. :-)
1	1	If you instead put this into the gerrit-server directory, you can then refactor the AdminSetParent SSHD command to also use this implementation.  That would reduce the amount of code needed to add this feature, since its mostly just extracting the existing code from AdminSetParent.
1	2	From the stack trace you can see I put this on the wrong line, oops.
1	1	style-nit: I think spaces around ""+"" are preferred in Gerrit's code base.
1	1	It shouldn't break, it just doesn't use the $site_path/tmp location until gerrit.sh is updated to a new version to supply GERRIT_TMP in the environment when launching the daemon.

We already have schema upgrades between 2.4 and 2.5. I think most users will be running init anyway.
1	1	Reuse the ChangeControl instance instead of loading the change again.
1	1	#NAME?
1	1	Ah I see.  I wonder if we could improve the logic to only remove the expand all link when it is above a certain threshold, rather than any time it is above 30 lines with a huge file?

So remove the isHugeFile parameter and just check line.getSize()?
2	2	Style-nit: Please don't reformat these comment blocks.
1	1	You are missing

  usage = ""List of SSH session ids to be closed""

or some such.
1	1	I think this fits better as an overload in UnloggedFailure?
1	1	This should be rather initialized with an empty collection.
2	1	I have no idea what this means, but this is probably not the place to fix it!
1	4	Note that this isn't manual wrapping, just splitting the single string into multiple strings to follow the indentation (it should have been narrrower here, though).

This way it will still be properly wrapped both for terminals and GUI cmake interfaces. The only bad choice is when we indent the strings _without_ using quotes on each line - then Cmake interprets it as manual line wrapping with extra spaces (at least on my host), which will look horrible if you are not using a terminal window.
2	1	FIXME! As mentioned elsewhere, the polling wait is likely unnecessary in the  OpenCL implementation.
1	1	Done (hopefully the text is also otherwise a bit clearer).
2	2	magnus, to write something along the lines of this is the number of sets of the most frequently written output type per frame set. the best default will need some experimentation. ideally this would be a user-configurable option, but it is not clear whether a (hidden) command-line option would be best (or env var), and not clear whether anybody would really use it in practice. Disk is cheaper than user and/or compression time, for the most part. So we'll add a TODO to reconsider for 5.1(?) and not before.
1	1	That's impossible to say until somebody invests the time and effort to try lots of different function approximations on that architecture to see if they can come up with something better. For now it is the fastest approach.
1	2	That will unfortunately only work if there are no 4-core Intel Xeons that work in dual-socket configuration because we could confuse a workstation that has two such processors with an 8-core Xeon E5 in single-socket configuration.
2	2	Sounds like it should be disabled. It is reasonable to run a whole multi-sim workflow (em, equil phases, simulate) in the same set of multi-dirs, so being able to use

 mdrun_mpi -multidir the-dirs* -deffnm equil-npt

would be a nice thing. I haven't tried -multidir with a non-default equil-npt that I remember though.

Should we be looking at doing the directory change for -multidir earlier than we do?
2	1	No, because this file and this macro is also used from plain C code, which only accepts this form of casting. Adding #ifdefs just for this purpose does not seem useful.
2	1	I want to keep it for now - there might be new architectures/optimizations where we suddenly realize it would be useful. Having them in config.h.cmakein is a reasonable compromise to remember we can use them, although they aren't selectable directly in Cmake for the moment.
1	1	We kept this in r46 to keep some minor behaviour consistent.

By omitting this in r50, we are actually keeping the behaviour of rc and final consistent, modulo the bug fix - see this function in git diff 53fc9d0 -- src/gromacs/mdlib/coupling.c. Since the r50 tests are already generated with the new RNG, we should expect those tests to continue to pass.
2	2	I don't understand the problem. Without the explicit assign, and copy operator, and without the AnalysisNeighborhoodSearch(const ImplPointer &) (not needed if the setMode is done easier), I don't see why it wouldn't just work by itself correctly with gmx_unique_ptr. Sorry if I'm miss something obvious.
1	1	Also guessing, but if multiple loops act on the same vector and that vector exceeds a cache level, then you can do slightly better by alternating the order of loop traversal, so that you do re-use what you do have in cache.
1	1	I mainly tried declaring all variables in the local-most scope.
1	2	Why is 1 the default? Why isn't the default to use all available cores? This is the default for mdrun and also the default behavior of OpenMP.
1	1	First, we'd need to fix grompp, since it wrote this file ;-)
3	3	I thought the point of the platform file is to make it easier by requiring only one option. Of course the user can also simply use ""CC=icc CXX=icpc CFLAGS=-mmic CXXFLAGS=-mmic"". If I don't specify the compiler then what's the point of having a platform file at all? 

I'm pretty sure gcc will never support the MIC vector instructions (compiling with gcc works but is of course useless without the vector instructions). And it seems also very unlikely that clang will ever support it.
1	1	shouldn't that be exp(-beta_i u_i) / sum_k exp(beta_k u_k)
2	1	That could be changed, I imagine, but Jenkins will probably add ""helpful"" spacing too... :-(

If there was a way to have Jenkins keep a per-build archive, then we could have it make available the corrected files?
1	1	The histograms themselves don't use multipoint storage. The input for them often would be, but in this case it isn't.
1	2	By definition, nothing is required when we have macros telling whether it is present or not. To avoid having to update this file every time something in one of the implementation files changes, I would move that documentation there. This file is simply about SIMD and defining SIMD properties, not about what SIMD instructions are used in different kernels. Specific comments about verlet kernels belong in the verlet kernel code, not here.
1	2	The include won't become redundant as the macros will still be needed. Instead the replicated Check{C,CXX}CompilerFlag.cmake will become redundant.
1	1	The logic to check for checkpoint restart was added in release-5-1, but in master we changed the name to startingFromCheckpoint
2	1	I guess this specifies whether the file is an xvg file? Then I would suggest introducing an enumerated type instead, both because we might have more file types to test in the future, and because it's is much more explicit with FileType_Xvg than true as the last parameter in calls to this function.

Alternatively, isn't it possible to decipher the filetype from the extension?
1	1	Not sure what our own script has to do with the annotation. The export pragma could all be moved into the imp file if you prefer that. This would leave us with only the keep for where we misusing the preprocessor as template language (pme.c). I think we should replace this anynow. 

Right now if one runs it on any of the c++ files, IWYU makes changes we don't want. See the issues in the commit message. But I don't see how that could be fixed by using a script to read the output. It seems it would be easier to patch IWYU than replicating the header-analysis in a post-processing script.
3	1	Joseph Coffland requested this.  Apparently he was doing a non-CMake build where he just set GMX_THREAD_MPI.  I'm fine replying that he should set GMX_MPI as well.  Preferences?
1	1	Removed. This was originally a From/To test, but then decided to split it and forgot to remove this part.
3	2	It is the same argument, that we want positive constants for time constants.
1	1	Prefer angle brackets for headers not provided by us.
1	2	Update: Tried to make the unary member operators, but apparently even gtest requires binary comparison operators to work on objects, so I'll have to abandon that.
2	3	This conditional is always true, so it should be removed as confusing.
1	1	I guess this must be an unsigned integer because of the way we shift bits in the next file. However, in that case the width too is likely important, and I would suggest using gmx_uint32_t for clarity.
1	1	We only move bonds to the same place or back. So bond j is always tested. In the extreme case there are no H-bonds and the loop is simply a copy from i to j=i. Also note that this code has been tested in the nbnxn_hybrid_acc branch.
1	1	I would like to rewrite in C++, but that requires all the calling programs to be C++ too. Will do that in a separate patch.
1	2	It seems to me that we have a more serious issue here.
4	1	Indeed, thanks.

I discovered this myself early last week, and addressed it in I82ff6602af3bf5 so that we use gcc 4.9.3 on slaves where that matters. Love these commercial-grade compilers!
2	1	You removed this line in I1c2a5a9c3da5 with a commit message that noted you wanted COM removal only in the second half of VV, but there was no related change to how that worked. How do we assess when you were right? :-D
2	1	I think !S_ISREG is too broad. If the filename is a symlink, then don't we want to be able to open it?

The original code tested for S_ISDIR, which might well be best. I just wanted us to consider whether there were other things for which to test.
5	1	It's an excellent day when there's more documentation than the core developers can remember having!
1	2	We should revisit the entire allocation after 5.1, but that could have unexpected side-effects, so it's not something we want to hack as a last-minute bugfix.
3	1	I'll add a comment. 
I don't think #ifdef is a good idea. It makes bugs more likely because you have more code and that code is less tested (because only one version is only compiled and run on any one system).  But I will include the non-workaround version in the comment.
1	1	OK, moved back to shellfc.cpp.
Implemented the std::array busines. Phew.
1	2	That this was removed is clearly wrong, and seems to be the cause for the test which hang. It doesn't always hang but sometimes. For more details: http://redmine.gromacs.org/boards/6/topics/261?r=266
1	1	with the suggested while loop this would become i =0
4	1	whoops, this is not new code, but docs are always good!
2	1	Not in the present version at least. Note that I have not yet had access to xlc with VSX, so that will have to wait until we get that!
1	1	Not all build tools use -j. Thus the simpler approach of directly setting build_cmd=""make -j2""/""jom -j4"" might be better.
1	1	I could put the finalizeForCommandLine after processExceptionAtExit. Then it doesn't change anything for LIB_MPI and that wouldn't work anyhow as you point out.
2	2	I started replacing C0 with c[0] because I didn't see a significant advantage of having C0 available. But then I saw this and realized this AI naming is used in some other places. And it might be helpful to have the I..M index. I thought about creating an enum to define I to M (to use as a[I]) but of course I to M would be by itself bad names which conflict easily with other things. And I thought it would be nice to have C and A by consistent. So I also created CO..C2 not just AI..AM. I think consistency with the previous name is more important than consistency to the variable name. But it doesn't really matter to me.
3	2	Isn't ""a system dependent pseudo random seed"" even more cryptic to the average user? How would you formulate it isn't unusual verbose compared to the other options and not cryptic to the average user? A section in the manual explaining how our random numbers work is (while a good idea) outside the scope of this change.
3	2	OK, thanks.

The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want. 

When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same.

When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more!

When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c ""You, too, could be using RDTSCP!"". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though.

I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough.

So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag, commit message needs updating.
1	1	No. Note that what I write is not real and reciprocal space. Below the cut-off we have both the real space and reciprocal space contribution.
3	1	Ja, if there were a clean way to have the old name mean a new -q version that'd be fine, but I think this is the best we can do.
1	1	need to fix this to ""num"" not ""max""
omp_get_num_threads
2	1	OK will work on the object containing tolerances for both precisions, with the helper functions intended to be the main way to construct them.
3	2	It works pretty well and provides status information for impatient users. Note that nrms is a shared variable among the threads and that the line is overprint with the carriage return character in a fifo manner.
2	1	This is a workaround for WDDM that does not belong here. IMO it would be best split out into a separate commit so that there is a clear record of it.

Additionally, has this been tested thoroughly?
1	2	Is ""how many times have *"", I updated the comment.
Note that the nstglobalcomm removal is not directly related to this patch, but that was uncorrect, since nstglobalcomm counts in MD steps, whereas n_load_have counts DD partitionings.
100 might be a bit high for short runs, but for any longer run DLB will still trigger within a very small fraction of the total runtime.
1	1	I have the feeling that we should perhaps split the functionality here and use a separate enum for OpenCL which would indicate the forking point if a future OCL device needs different cluster size. Perhaps an overkill now, but it would not hurt.
2	2	True. To be honest, initially I wanted to avoid passing a bunch of arguments so I thought it does not matter whether I count the unique GPU IDs or their indices and that's why I had ngpu = gpu_info->ncuda_dev_use (but PS 1 was messed up in other ways so I changed ngpu, and I indeed should have removed the branch. 

Long story short: thanks.
2	1	I thought that the full list of commands can be rather long, so it's best to print it only on explicit request. If there was a mechanism for printing only a subset of the commands, then that could be used here.

But it may be better to wait until there are more modules ready before doing anything more complex. Having a ""commonly used"" subset here requires someone to define what those are, and also requires extra logic somewhere to communicate that subset to the help printing code. For now, I think it is best to keep things simple.
2	5	Yeah, major documentation work in the next few weeks, so we can all use our time more efficiently when new or wasn't-paying-attention-then developers come on board. Today, only worried about completing the rc while not creating repeat work later! :-)
1	2	This has to be restored to the initial code:
#include ""thread_mpi/atomic.h""

It is a remaining from an intermediate OpenCL development stage. In CUDA source files CUDA and non-CUDA data structures and headers are mixed together. This cannot happen with OpenCL, you cannot use C/C++ standard library headers or any other headers relying on those (see section 6.9 https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/specs/opencl-1.2.pdf)
2	1	This is the same as in the underlying OS calls, and this same construct is also used in the nbsearch pair loop, as it minimizes the amount of code the caller needs to write for correct looping (and is quite easy to implement, as there's only one function that returns something).
2	2	Not currently. It's somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses, as I guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test (since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere, you do not really benefit from serialization).

Generic serialization is also a significant amount of code, even if straightforward (and with C++, it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types, unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization).
1	1	Why replace the ip[] only here and not consistently_
1	1	OK. I agree there's a sense that the state of the machine is not const.
1	2	Ok, this is a bit for my learning--apart from the weirdness, would it be better to do static const const char * here (consistent use of modifiers on the left)?  Still bending my mind around the subtleties of multiple const qualifiers in the same line...
1	1	Why not use num_threads(gmx_omp_nthreads_get(emntNonBonded)) - and perhaps add an assert(gmx_omp_nthreads_get(emntNonBonded) == nnbl)?

Additionally, there are three more loops over the lists, can some of them be merged into one parallel region with this?
1	1	""system-provided version"" or ""version provided by the system""
3	1	Good point. I think it is related to the change as the new message is introduced here.
1	1	could this moved to config.h instead of having it on the command line?
1	1	indeed.  I see why it's there...I don't suppose there's a clean way to make this better?  Looking at do_xdr(), nothing comes to mind immediately.
1	2	I far prefer the load/store naming since anybody who has ever worked with SIMD will know exactly what we're doing. 

The point is to maybe make the SIMD code slightly less cluttered, and _maybe_ make it possible to for some simple routines to be templated, not to design a new language.
3	2	We should move this to some other module since it has very little to do with SIMD, and it was only a hack for a single architecture. However, that will require us to write a different hardware module, so for now I've added a define for GMX_SIMD when any of the SIMD architectures is enabled (which is good to have anyway).
3	1	It seems to me that the above helpers would be better suited in a different file to keep this file a purely generator one. Does that make sense? is there any good reason to keep it here?
3	2	It is not too late to do one. But because this runs also on the client and I am not sure how compatible those are with the Java ones I decided to write it this way.

But you can look at the one I wrote for the source level in Utility.versionPattern if you feel nostalgic.


You made me learn GWT regexps and do it!!! and it is here for all to see with all the regexp beautiful simplicity.
1	1	Removed 'to' as the assertion is there for mostly documentation purposes.
2	1	These are nice tests. Can we put them on AbstractHasData directly instead of the Table subclass?
The one bit that you'd have to keep here would be the test with the alternative TableBuilder.
1	1	It is not obvious to me what this code snippet is doing; can you add a comment?
1	2	[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'check that a space is left after a colon on an assembled error message'.
2	2	I think we should also force the configuration property to not be multi valued.
2	1	When you swap a KEY_RIGHT for a KEY_LEFT in RTL, that's because you're interested in the ""start of the line"" (which is on the left in LTR) rather than the left vs. right; so in the ""case KEY_LEFT"", the comment could say ""start of the line, no special RTL handling"".
1	1	Will take a look after we decide how to move forward.
1	2	Any ideas why this might not have been public originally?  Obviously no immediate consequences to making it public, just wondering if we should try to discourage people from using it if there are alternatives.
2	1	It seems clearer to return Future<?> here and let the caller set the variable.

A better name would be something like startAddingEntryToCache since the postcondition is that when it returns, the task is scheduled. (Assuming the persistent unit cache is running at all.)
1	2	[error] Wrong order for 'java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream' import.
1	1	Maybe move this to getStringMethod and rename getStringMethod to getStringMethodOverload?
1	1	How about just moving it to RequestFactoryTestBase instead of a top-level class?
1	1	It seems better to throw UnableToCompleteException in this case; there's no need to print the stack trace.
1	1	[info] Unable to get class information for @throws tag 'UnableToCompleteException'.
2	1	The main thing about ""Dev Mode Off"" is that it works even when the code server isn't running. Perhaps it's less useful with this change, but I don't want to remove it yet.
2	2	Sure it's more readable, but how about:

 HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();
 ??ª??
 hrc.add(foo.addXxxHandler(??ª??));
 ??ª??
 hrc.add(bar.addYyyHandler(??ª??));

or:

 HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();
 ??ª??
 HandlerRegistration hr1 = ??ª??
 hrc.add(hr1);
 ??ª??
 HandlerRegistration hr2 = ??ª??
 hrc.add(hr2);

I.e. accumulate HandlerRegistration instances right into the HRC (which can be a field of your class) rather than into local variables that you then pass as a whole to the factory method.

If you want varargs, you could add an addAll() method:

 HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();
 hrc.addAll(hr1, hr2);

or with a Collection or Iterable as argument:

 HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();
 hrc.addAll(Arrays.asList(hr1, hr2));

Note that Sencha has not felt the need to add such collection/varargs to their GroupingHandlerRegistration: http://docs.sencha.com/gxt/3/com/sencha/gxt/core/shared/event/GroupingHandlerRegistration.html

Similar for GWT-P's registerHandler on their PresenterWidget base class: http://arcbees.github.io/GWTP/javadoc/apidocs/com/gwtplatform/mvp/client/HandlerContainerImpl.html#registerHandler(com.google.web.bindery.event.shared.HandlerRegistration)
1	1	This follows the common toXXX naming convention and implementation style used in Guava. I need fix the documentation.
1	1	The performance characteristics of ArrayList should be similar enough to use here instead of introducing JsObjectArray.
1	2	This is a Maven project, and Maven's default build directory is ""target"" (see also the .classpath file generated by M2Eclipse)
2	2	Here, we are making a bunch of datastore calls in a loop, which could fail (or time out) and drop half of the updates.

Since this is derived data and an async update is probably okay, a more robust approach would be to put tasks on the App Engine task queue to refresh each graph. Failed tasks automatically get retried.

The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id, regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies, sort of like a makefile. Then, since it's idempotent, it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes, and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter.

(Incremental updates would be more efficient but trickier to get right, so I typically put that off until it seems necessary.)
1	1	I agree if the file exist we should skip the conversion and print a information message
1	2	I think either all the modification are propagated ""live"" or they are all buffered, having a mix of both seems to be a gate for inconsistency.
1	2	Is this only relevant for new Js interop or was it also a bug with regular JSOs?

If it was a bug with JSOs, we should add the relevant regression test.
2	2	i did some refactoring and missed changing this name. thanks for catching it
1	2	[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'more than one blank line'.
1	1	Done. Wonder why checkstyle did not complain here this time.
1	1	I think you're right that this seems only natural. I will leave the code for this commented out by a flag for now, and figure out a way to add a 'lint' mode to JSORestrictionsChecker later to warn when turned on.
1	2	[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'check that a space is left after a colon on an assembled error message'.
2	2	please add a comment explaining why leaving a try statement in the AST (with no catch blocks and no finally block) would leave the AST in an unsafe state
2	2	That means we'll have to add an extra boolean field to every member. It'll make serialization size bigger as well as resident AST memory go up. 

I'm happy to change it, but it seems like it trades off memory for readability.

You'd still have to handle """", because that's the way Java annotations work, you cannot have a default value of 'null'
1	1	I think we should make it very clear that this is an asynchronous process:

""Enqueues a clean up of old cache files...""
1	2	[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'check that a space is left after a colon on an assembled error message'.
1	3	The problem is, at the opensource side, if this breaks the app, people will try to debug it by themselves or worse they will just give up and do not update to the latest GWT version - I don't want that to happen, especially for this release.

On the other hand if somebody hits the problem, it is easy to point them to the workaround. This is not ideal situation but that is what I prefer right now.
2	2	Other parts rely on non-null values, perhaps this should be critical.
Anyway, let's not expand preconditions beyond JRE for now and submit the patchset that I already +2'd.
1	1	renamed to __initPropertyProviders in this scope to indicate that we consider it private in this scope otherwise initPropertyProviders
1	1	I'm not sure we need a fallback? The server should have set the version correctly.
2	2	I agree with Thomas.  We should benchmark if it doesn't make a measurable difference, we should get rid of the customization if that's the only reason for us to have this file.

I expect by now more time has been spent optimizing the JDK's HashMap than has been spent on com.google.gwt.dev.util.collect.HashMap. :)
1	1	That is intended. We are already making sure that multiple events are okay for us (see onHashChanged). So I think this is the most practical way.
2	1	i thought i was already using the guava Files class in the same file. but i guess that was only true in the test file.

done
3	1	It is pretty inconsitent. Some have very short descriptions (like this one) others only point to the jdk doc (which is what I will do).

Big TODO update all url pointers.
1	2	[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'more than one blank line'.
1	1	I remember 'Url' was the suggested one but URL class itself was all upper case so I was in between. I'm changing it to fromUrl.
1	1	Does this change apply to all uses of this rule?

I suggest making this plural form optional so people can transition to using it over time rather than flooding them with warnings.
1	2	Perhaps we can collapse setMonth and setYear and call it setDate. Currently both method changes behavior depending on isMonthDdVisible and isYearDdVisible and it is hard to track the flow.

We can still keep the method simple by extracting the code that re-populates ""yearSelect"" into a method.
1	2	[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'more than one blank line'.
1	1	you'll need someone with some maven experience to review this
2	2	You don't need to put this xml or a new test class.

That means in a previous test case you can just do following:

@WithProperties({
    @Property(name = ""webApiUsage"", value = ""resistance"")
  })
public void testAnimationImpInResistanceMode() {
  // your test code here
}
1	1	Actually this is to make sure at that at the end the streams are flushed. Maybe it is completely unnecessary.
1	2	I actually misguided you here. typeName was already fully qualified and looks enough to figure out what the message was saying and find culprits. (for some reason I thought this was the member name and not qualified).
Anyway sorry about that.
You may consider reverting the related change to keep it consistent and make the code slightly simpler by getting rid of maps.
Anyway I will leave it up to you how to proceed.
1	2	[error] Wrong order for 'com.google.gwt.dev.javac.asmbridge.EmptyVisitor' import.
3	1	Maybe this comment:
// The old CSS resource has no support for many at-rules, like animations. There is no way for us to parse them using the old CSS parser, so we will just output them as a string to the GSS stylesheet and hope that the GSS parser is okay with the rule
2	1	please also mention that it builds the overriding/overridden method lists inside the JMethod instances
1	1	What do you think about my last paragraph? Do you think it's really needed to have a parseDevMode and parseProdMode methods?
1	2	[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'more than one blank line'.
1	2	so before this patch, this m() method dispatch would have come out wrong in an incremental recompile?
1	1	(I think you could indent this line another four spaces if you want.)
1	2	[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'more than one blank line'.
2	1	It is a matter not related with this commit, but shouldn't be an optimization if we replace 'n"" with "";"" instead of ""\n"" so as we save some bytes in final JS?

We should consider edge cases like  ',n' in js objects, etc, though
1	1	You only need assertTrue(Object.class instanceof Type);

The rest will break GWT test for the cases where there is no metadata available.
1	1	Yes. I am preserving current semantics in this patch.
2	2	I think this is because JTypeOracle.isInstantiatedType(JReferenceType) returns true for any JsType.

Roberto has a comment in there to remove this hack when CFA is more precise. By removing the JInstanceOf rescue, you now can no longer remove this hack.
3	2	I already have another use case. If an app needs per package log configuration (as in JDK), this is good way to support that. So I prefer to keep it as it doesn't complicate the code.
1	1	fragmentDescriptors probably the most appropriate name here.
1	1	Should I fix this? or change it to a non-javadoc comment?
1	1	This was not possible updated to use the proper state variable...
1	1	ServiceImpl? (To match the interface.)

Or else rename all of them:
DashboardServiceImpl, DashboardService, DashboardServiceAsync
1	2	I think it should be optimizerCtx.getLastStepFor(NAME)+1, since the methods which are last modified by DeadCodeElimination are deadcode-free.

Another concern is that when it is called by MethodInliner, actually we want to traverse the methods that modified by MethodInliner, not all the modified methods since last DeadCodeElimination. The result would be the same, but it may do unnecessary work in MethodInliner.
2	1	i think it's more common in Java to treat abbreviations as words when in an identifier name, so ""BenchmarkResultJson""

please apply throughout
1	1	[error] // comments must be followed by a space and be on their own line
1	1	A side effect of the refactoring I used to create the hasWholeWorldKnowledge method. Fixed
2	1	Yes, it's only been moved from the beginning of the file to the end.

I think ideally we'd update to a newer version but I don't know Objectify and whether 3.x is compatible with 4.x or 5.x.
GAE 1.7.1 is a bit old too.
1	1	[error] Got an exception - expecting EOF, found '}'
2	1	Is there any practical reason to skip class literals in JsInterface chains other than code size? Please add an explanation here.
1	2	[error] 'static' modifier out of order with the JLS suggestions.
1	2	[info] Line matches the illegal pattern 'check that a space is left after a colon on an assembled error message'.
2	2	So, is it safe to use it in production? Or should we add a warning that it should be disabled before putting your app in prod?

If it's safe to use it in production, how about enabling it by default? Or do we push it to GWT 3.0?
1	1	[error] Got an exception - expecting EOF, found 'registered'
2	1	Value stored to 'offset' is never read (Clang Analyzer)
2	2	Why this special case? It did not exist before and all it callers seem to take it from a tvb (except for a hard-coded 2000 in EnhancedAlarmMessage, which seems wrong too as the length is not checked there?)
1	1	Because it is used below in g_list_foreach, where gpointer is mandated.
1	1	You ca use directly val_to_str on HF VALS(xip_serval_proto_vals...)
2	3	In my opinion a distinction needs to be drawn between IPv6 header bogus length and extension header bogus length. Whether all the different extension header should use the same expert_field or not for length is another issue, it's debatable but my current opinion is that they should be separate, i.e, ei_ipv6_routing_invalid_length, ei_ipv6_dstopts_invalid_length, etc. but if someone thinks differently please share.
1	1	unused parameter 'pinfo' [-Werror=unused-parameter]
1	1	Feedback from Michael (Pergament) (Author of this code) :

It should be && according to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7432 (7, 7.4). If it is smaller than neither IPv4 not IPv6 address is provided.
2	2	This should be safe because this string isn't really used in the GUI - it's used as one of the arguments in a later format string, so it's copied. In fact I could (and probably should) just use NULL instead of packet_scope().
1	1	They're not, and can't be. Same as with proto fields that this code is a copy of... and quite a few other pre-existing Lua code spots too for that matter.
2	1	Does time_sec_to_str ""format"" the field better than an FT_UINT16?  Or does it just add an ""s"" to the value (which you may want to keep for consistency).
1	1	unused parameter 'p_info' [-Werror=unused-parameter]


(p_info ? -> pinfo ?)
1	1	Why sizeof(guint8), shouldn't that be length again?
1	1	Instead of malloc() maybe you can use stack: gchar tmpname[41]; 41 is enough? Cannot be greater?
1	1	You probably need to check for divide-by-zero here, since addr_len comes from compr, which is based on packet data.
1	1	Move up with other ""just set reserved = 7"" case statements?
3	1	I think there should be a maximum size, and scrolling should start from there. with 53 options, there would be a good case for implementing a tab-structure in the dialog.
1	1	same comment as above: use wmem_map_new() with file scope memory
1	1	No need for the above...

The commit log & diff & etc provides info about the change.
1	1	Alternative? The ret pointer will be free'd outside of this function, therefore I need to return a pointer here. and *ret is assigned NULL above (instead of the g_new as before).

If I'd return just NULL, it would add complexity to code outside.
1	2	I have been told in the past some compilers don't initialize all elements to 0 with 'foo[n]={0};' - I've never found such a compiler, so maybe it's an urban legend. :)

memset() yup shoulda done that. Ironically I looked for a memset equivalent in glib, so I don't know why I didn't use it.
1	1	Now that I'm really looking at the code, would not the right fix be to change toknext to be signed instead of unsigned (so that the for loop stops immediately), or to check that it is > 0?
if tokens = NULL, then parser->toknext will always be set to 0.

That said, your change is somehow equivalent so we could keep it as-is.
1	1	I prefer the Alcatel-lucent.xylan (i will update the dicto after...)
1	2	In theory (per the comments) a retransmission should be caught in the code block above. This is not the case?
3	3	Cosmetic: According to last changes related to tvb_captured_length and tvb_reported_length it is good point to start thinking about ""reported"" case (btsnoop format provide both frame length). In ""reported"" case we can have only part of frame: for example first 2 bytes. This dissector will fail at this line, so nothing will be dissected, but if you move lines 131-140,(169)171-181 directly before place when it will be use then we can dissect some fields. ""context"" can be filled somewhere about line current 202, ""rf_channel"" can be put between lines 144-145, ""aa_offenses"" can be fetch after 170 or where ""context"" is filled, the problem is ""flags"", but after moved it after line 147 you are able to decode ""btle_rf_channel"" field etc.
1	1	tabs instead of whitespaces as in the rest of the file
2	2	Mostly to save typing and avoid wrapping.  There are so many of these that have almost exactly the same parameters and would need to be wrapped if written out plainly.  I thought it made it cleaner and clearer.

If you prefer I can write out the whole thing.
1	1	unused parameter 'pinfo' [-Werror=unused-parameter]
1	1	This comment doesn't sound right.  This if statement should be removed as lapd_handle should already be populated.
2	1	Seems like I messed up the alignment in my patch by one space off.

But other than that I think it is still useful for readability, even though you are right that it is not perfectly consistent for every array entry.

Is it ok if I just fix the alignment for the array entries relevant to this patch instead?
1	1	Yes remove alignement (because there is no real alignement... if you look other hf)
1	1	Oops, I guess I forgot to type 'make' after fixing that.

Anyway, I finished my commits review in the meantime too.
1	3	find_or_create_conversation() cannot return a NULL pointer by design. It makes dissect_payload label useless.
1	1	Yes this API has recently changed.  No longer handled through packet_info.  See gssapi_encrypt_info_t in packet-gssapi.h
1	1	should be 10 and not 8, there are 2 extra bytes used for padding in these versions of Tomcat
2	2	Do people really type all that junk? ;-) Anyway I added it together with how to avoid typing all that junk. :-)
1	1	I don't believe so.

I was using it, but because we have messages that can be one byte long (such as a keepalive) and some messages that require as much as 32 bytes to determine others I needed something more flexible.
1	1	We probably want tvb_reported_length_remaining() here
1	1	We probably want tvb_reported_length_remaining() here
1	1	Yes, I reviewed the whole file and only identified this one.
1	2	This two without prefix? ""Normally"" --capture does not work without --extcap-interface (or tool can be implemented with default interface... [and fifo to stdout])
1	1	The proto_item_set_text is not needed in this context.  Removed
1	1	Field length expected here is 2, but field below is FT_INT32.
Is this an unsigned short (FT_UINT16) ?
1	1	I think this can be refactored (with the RTU ""duplication"") into the Modbus dissector.
1	1	Git ? ;-)

But i think we can remove this section...
1	2	You can remove these functions now and use logcat_text_dump_open in dump routines in file_access.c
1	2	Consider using expert_add_info and use the proto_item* returned from proto_tree_add_item(ath_tree, hf_ath_hlen, ...) so that the hlen field that is bad is highlighted)
1	1	I can do that in an extra commit, here I only wanted to add the possibility to access the created proto_item. But if you want me to, I can add the change to this commit also.
1	1	ip6_addr.bytes is no more initialized with this change.
1	1	strdup_printf with just a %s can be replaced with just strdup :)

This copy is necessary though, since the string coming into the function might be packet-scope
1	1	session_args_t structure is in packet scope. Is this normal to allocate in file scope? And no need to set it to 0, you are assigning it the line below.
2	2	No need to include wtap.h. ou can instead test pinfo->fd->cap_len and pinfo->fd->pkt_len.
But it might be btter to compare tvb_captured_length() and tvb_reported_length().
Moreover I do not see why setting it here would be useful (I might have missed something) as this function seems related to RPC over UDP.
1	1	possibly add a commented out example of packet-foo.src
1	2	packet-s7comm.c:2550:23: error: unused parameter 'data' [-Werror,-Wunused-parameter]
                void *data)

(use _U_ to set unused parameter)
1	2	need to guard this with a static bool so it's only executed once, assuming the above ""her_dissector_delete()"" is removed.
1	1	I think that this should be removed, and phdr->len and phdr->caplen needs to be incremented by 1 + 16 instead (see other comments below).
2	2	Please rename this to extcap-capture-filter or similar. The convention here is, that the extcap arguments exist together with non-extcap arguments in a binary. --capture and --fifo are the only exceptions, because they start the process and fifo is a generic argument.
1	2	Add expert info if there is pad high and no pad low ?
and also a generated hf with the padding length ?
2	2	It's one less file to update for anyone adding an extcap executable. I was hoping to migrate the Windows buildbots to CMake this week, which would make this less critical.
2	1	No need to check for NULL because g_strdup will do this.
And if value == NULL then tv->value will be uninitialised.
1	2	?? use _U_ on declaration function ? (to avoid unused parameter warning)
1	3	As remember filtering name can be related to expert information - this give you more filtering options. For example ""btle.crc.incorrect"" and ""Incorrect CRC""
1	1	Use tvb_ip_to_str.  That should eliminate the need for arpa/inet.h
2	2	We need to enter in this IF block only in case of unknown protocol, so when dissector_try_heuristic() return value is 0.
1	1	Use spaces, rather than tabs, here, for consistency.
2	1	Please change it to
 
    ws_info_t *ws_info = NULL;
1	1	Same WERROR_COMMON_FLAGS note, guard by if(WERROR_COMMON_FLAGS)?
1	2	Here (and several other places) you use the result of tvb_captured_length() where I would think tvb_reported_length() would be more appropriate? The amount of data on the wire is reported_length; captured_length takes into account snapshotting which you probably don't want to do.
3	1	Maybe we could copy information about filters and statistics to the result pcap file. I have tested this and it seems to works fine at least in my cases
1	1	Wouldn't it be simpler to just retrieve the bytes using tvb_get_ntoh* functions which will both fetch the bytes and do the necessary swapping in one step?
1	1	I can do that. Easier for me. Up to you (the reviewers). Should I go ahead and change it?
1	1	It is possible to kept alcatel-lucent.xylan (and remove the other)

Xylan has buy by Alcatel in 1999... (if i remember..)
2	1	As every callback is only interested at the part starting at the token, what about using frame + offset here and dropping the p - frame in the callbacks?
1	1	personally, i prefer to have only with space after comma
1	1	You could eventually create 1 hf entry per size. For sizes <=32 bits, you can use the same filter name. But for those above 32 bits, you need another filter name (as seen in README.dissector chapter 1.5.1)
2	1	I have some reservations about making this a user facing option. Each option should be easily understandable and widely applicable IMO. This is an internal debug aid.
2	1	Hi Nigel,

Is it better to use ""nbsp;"" instead of "".""?

In case other screens want to use this in the future - it's more generic.

But, it's up to you.  

It actually works quite well the way it is.

Thanks,
Ghada
1	1	This doesn't seem to be listed as things being fixed for this patch. Also it doesn't seem to work in Raw theme. 
As the hook 'local_header_top_content()' can be used by anyone it should show the menu for any theme. 

Currently the menu is hidden behind other things.
1	1	Hi Robert,

$lang is undefined at this point.

Ghada
1	1	i would add a new variable with the tag name, this will make it so you can show which tags don't have any results
3	1	Ah good point - I hadn't noticed that patch get merged.

Have removed the field_exists and table_exists checks
2	1	this is escapable, p['title'] could be something like '""><script>dodgycode</script><a href=""'
1	2	There are still several rows for the distinct blocks and up to one separate row with no related block element, so we still need the gorup by clause
2	1	Hi Gregor,

Continuing on from the mandatory system fields, the below code will save the socialprofile data:

    elseif ($field == 'socialprofile') {
        // For new social profiles.
        $classname = generate_artefact_class_name($field);
        $profile = new $classname(0, array('owner' => $userid));
        $profile->set('title',       $value['socialprofile_profileurl']);
        $profile->set('description', $value['socialprofile_service']);
        $profile->set('note',        $value['socialprofile_profiletype']);
        $profile->commit();
    }

Thanks,
Ghada
1	1	(to answer your question from the other patchset) yes, i think we should avoid duplicating this copyright info. there's not really any point in maintaining it in two places.

Also, this is a minor point, but ""onwards"" is not a meaningful thing to add. You can't claim copyright on future years. You can add years later, but technically, you have your copyright for a set period from the ""publication"" date.
1	1	similar comments to the other one, you should use pieforms or a template for the form here, and adding to info_msg is probably not the most ideal way
1	1	I think there's a function for doing this. Maybe display_name()? I think you pass it a whole ""usr"" record and viewer and it figures out how to display it.
1	2	it will be ""group 01"" according to the group created earlier but also there is a problem in the fact that the string we are looking for has quotes in it as well. Maybe use a single quote for wrapping the string
2	4	Only Firefox currently supports default parameters, so this causes a syntax error on Chrome ... I dread to think what IE would do. I think it would work just to remove the ""=false"" since parameters default to ""undefined"" anyway
1	2	My bad, I did add one but then removed it again and forgot to change that line back
1	1	nitpick: if you move this line below, then you don't have to comment out the line below...
3	1	I see you are calling the same $user->get('institutions') twice.

It looks like this can be simplified to:
 
  $institutions = $user->get('institutions');
  if ( !$USER->get('admin') ) { // for institution admins
      $admin_institutions = array_filter($institutions, ""is_institute_admin"");
2	1	Hi Tobias,

You've got a typo (lenght -> length):

i.e.
if (firstChildSel.length < 1) {

Thanks,
Ghada
1	1	What happen if groups were imported to an institution different from 'mahara'?
2	1	Again, no new abstract functions in the API classes, please.
2	1	Because I am using EXISTS and NOT EXISTS to return rows - and they don't seem to play nice with  DISTINCT. If I add ""DISTINCT a.id"" to the sql query it still returns duplicate rows. So that is why I have to filter them after returning the sql results.
1	1	While we're changing the names of these triggers, let's fix the spelling of the word ""exceed"" as well. I think ""unmark_quota_exceed_upd_set"" should still be short enough.
1	1	How do you get to the info below when the code above returns an array straight away?

some of this code is not needed
1	1	Should be $table = new XMLDBTable('usr_watchlist_artefact'), right?
1	1	Is this character class needed? Is there a reason why we can't use ([^<]+) ?
2	2	Yeah, $rawerror is a poor choice.

I've updated it and switch things around so now we have $isescaped which is the bool to check to see if we want to escape the error string or not. Set to true by default.
2	1	As things like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn are very popular right now I think we should have them in the list so that their proper icons are used.

Maybe we could have an Admin -> Extensions -> configuration form for this so an admin can add new options when needed that records the name that will appear in the dropdown and where to find it's related icon.

But maybe this will be a patch for a later time
1	3	Do you mean ""will be removed from the group""? If so, I'd add the ""From the group"" to avoid confusion. Some might think that the user is going to be removed from the system, i.e. deleted.

There are a couple of minor white spaces here (shown in red).
2	1	Hi Tobias,

Can you please put the XML close tag '>' at the beginning of the next line?

All the install.xml files in Mahara have that convention.

Thanks,
Ghada
1	1	Ok, changed it here and in the function above so as to make it more clear as to what is going on.
1	2	shouldn't this function be called:  rewrite_blockinstance_config

note the 'c' in blockinstance

so this would need the misisng 'c' and the calls to it
2	1	I had a further thought about this, because the kind of people who use old school css are the kind of people who could get stung by this. How about we add individual .gitignore files to each theme that has a gulpfile (including subthemestarter) and I can add something to the theming docs for using normal CSS to say 'delete the gitignore file'?
1	2	I disagree. I don't think that would shorten the code by much.
2	1	Hi Tobias,

Can you please fix the spaces here?

i.e. for ($i = 0; $i < count($record->userids); $i++) {

Thanks,
Ghada
1	1	Hi Bob,

I think the setting of screen resolution is not important as it makes no different when I changed it to smaller or larger size therefore I chose the medium size (1024x768).

It's hard to figure out what date of rendering the map and it does not really affect to the embed code I will remove it from the code.
2	2	There does not appear to be a file called ""site-logo-white.png"" in the master HEAD. Rather, each theme defines its own logo under htdocs/theme/{themename}/static/images/site-logo.png . This file may be dark or light depending on the color of the theme.

Hm... the skins patch added the site-logo-small-white.png file to the ""raw"" theme for this specific purpose. BUT, depending on the theme used on the page, the corresponding site-logo-small.png will not necessarily have dark text. On a dark-background theme, site-logo-small.png and site-logo.png will themselves have light text.

Unfortunately, it looks like what we need is a total of six files:

1. site-logo.png: Used in normal page headers

2. site-logo-light.png: Used on skinned Pages with ""light text logo""

3. site-logo-dark.png: Used on skinned Pages with ""dark text logo""

4. site-logo-small.png: Used in microheaders pages

5. site-logo-small-light.png: skinned, light text, micro-header pages 

6. site-logo-small-dark.png: skinned, dark text, micro-header pages

In most cases site-logo.png will be a copy of site-logo-light.png or site-logo-dark.png; likewise for site-logo-small.png.
2	1	Hi Gregor,

Need to make this accessible by adding ""class='accessible-hidden'"" with relevant details to labels; also add spans for hidden text; anchors with spans; buttons need to have ""alt"" text; etc.

Please refer to: https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Accessibility 
for more details.

Thanks,
Ghada
2	1	This will add an new <input name=""ajax""> everytime I change the switch.
Please add the code to make sure only one is appended.
3	1	Yep, I've added the latter db insert/delete bits in a transaction

I've kept out the 'update the item with start process time' bit because we want that to happen on success and failure
1	2	Does this has any effect? If the method is null, the field in the return set is NULL both ways, joined or not, or am I mistaken?
1	1	The above code from 2008101602 is present in the 1.1.0RC2_RELEASE so therefore existed before the 1.1.0_RELEASE so needs to be removed.
1	1	These variables are only used in the next call, I'd remove them
2	1	Hi Son,

Same as above. MySql doesn't like table aliases.

Thanks,
Ghada
3	1	you don't need the &amp; & will do fine, just like in your previous href
1	1	needs to be space around the => 
eg 
 $postid => $post
1	1	If your users often link their books or publications to one online catalogue, then you can set the URL prefix here, and they will only have to paste the book or publication ID at the end of the URL. You must make sure that your URL ends with a ""/"".

For example: If your users need to link to publications in WorldCat frequently, set the URL prefix to <pre>http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/</pre>, the the users only need to enter the publication ID at the end of the URL.
1	1	The 'all' link is a link that is js controlled - is 'follow' the right word to use here?
1	1	Is there a way to edit the commenteditabletime? I haven't spotted one.
2	1	never mind. found it in ""notification_internal_activity"" :) will see what I can do
2	1	Hi Nigel,

Not sure if they need to know that it's a 'javascript link'.  Maybe just 'link'?

Thanks,
Ghada
1	1	Again, removing this change will make your change smaller by taking this file out.
1	1	Instead of having ""%s"" of ""%s"" 
I'm thinking it should be ""%s"" belonging to ""%s""

I feel that both ""Page 1 belonging to Group 1"" and ""Page A belonging to Robert Lyon"" make more sense than ""Page 1 of Group 1"" and ""Page A of Robert Lyon""
1	2	We should rename this method to ""artefact_title_for_view_and_block()"". Because what it really does is tell you if the artefact has an alternate title when viewed in a specific View & Block.
1	1	Are you suggesting to remove the @copyright line? These are all over Mahara
1	2	The 'dirty flags'  look to be already handled by formchangechecker.js (and in a better way too).
1	1	Seem to of lost one upgrade path for the passwords, has this been rebased ontop of master? I notice that the last commit was, but not this
1	1	I would replace this line by 

$noteids = array_keys($data);

as $data is associate array with key = 'id'
1	1	This should be:

'fields' => array('socialprofile'),

since everything (the old messaging system info and the new social profile websites) is now 'socialprofile'.
We differentiate among these with 'note' field.
1	1	no ?

And would it actually be ""Process nested group objects""?

Help needed
1	1	What happens if a leap2a import's $entry->summary doesn't have any children at the path div->div?

Should we check to see if the $entry->summary->div->div->children() exist and fall back to $entry->summary if they don't?
1	1	as you suggested (in person) that probably should go into a template
1	2	How bad is it if the page already exists?

I'm thinking if a user needed to rerun the upgrade script for some reason, (ie they set the version number in db back down) it would be better not to have it die here but rather issue an info/warning message that page already exists.
 
The admin can always edit the template view to suit their needs if the page already exists for some reason.

Or maybe have it so the get_field db call checks to see if there is a portfolio page with owner = 0 but the title/description do not equal the default ones we set below - that way we would avoid the re-run of upgrade problem but still die on an unexpected page existing.
1	1	Already sitting in $configdata, so no need to repeat this.
1	2	Problem is the floating image in license stops the bottom margin working. I've added in a cb div and added some margin top to the feedback box
1	1	I keep finding myself wanting to click on the link that says ""Click image to edit"". Can we make that part of the link?
