Some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling CreateProcess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.

When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.

Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).

Just because your implementation may not do this, we can imagine other OEMs passing back obsolete responses that would match a newly-zero'd RIL sequence number and confuse things.

Exiting the loop doesn't do a final update of v. The write to conflict with this read must happen during the setup for a subsequent iteration. 

This one does bother me. To be clear, what's going on is:

go func() { x = v }()
v = a[1]

The main reason to use sort, though, is to give a consistent return value (iterating a map is randomized). I could simply drop the sorted guarantee and return them in randomized order.

func If(s RuneSet, tTrue, tFalse Transformer) Transformer

If performance is a concern, the If function could do a type assertion to see if s is a *unicode.RangeTable, and switch to an optimized implementation, the same way that the image/draw package does in the stdlib.

But I'm not sure if we even want a Ranges or If. The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes, then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk. Instead, I'd just loop over the input and append to a []byte. It's not like you have some input that contains both Code Page 437 and Shift-JIS and you want to switch between them. Your phone number Ranges example seems a bit contrived, and again, I'd just for/range over the string for that particular task.

So the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts... I do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of scripts[1]

So we left with rhel only to handle...

This is why I do not understand why we need any common application downstream specific logic.

That said browsers are getting better and better these days and we could just make the decision that we will use them and wait for browsers and VE to catch up.

What is if it was a wrong veto? The contributor try to explain me, in additional comments why he thinks the veto was wrong and that the impact of the change is *very* minimal and that thousands of people from hundreds of companies can't upgrade to the new version of the product and all that because of his veto.

If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true.

By making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>, and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible.  That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.

We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method, after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo. The only reason to have this class is to get the UiAction for granted (Guice DynamicItem binding and discovery).

But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now, on the client side, from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too, obviously.

This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all? We could add it to main page (or may be just add a keyboard shortcut), in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name (with suggestion oracle for project, like it already does for branches).

I don't have strong preference for one of these solutions. So, you can let it as is for now and wait for opinion of other reveiwers.

And well it shouldn't. If the project is inside a git repo, that git repo will be found at import, and inner repositories will be found by the resource change event handling after the import. If the project is not inside a git repo, then we'll never pick up folders that happen to be in some git repository, but that's ok because the project will not be EGit-managed anyway. Or did you want to support git functionality in non-EGit-managed projects? Now that would be a vary major change.

getContainer() just means ""get the IContainer this RepositoryMapping is attached to"". For inner repositories, this container will be an IFolder, and it will be at the root of the inner git repository's working directory.

One _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN, +-infinity, negative zero, etc? And, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-)

For the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future.

The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want. 

When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same.

When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more!

When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c ""You, too, could be using RDTSCP!"". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though.

I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough.

So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag, commit message needs updating.",https://gerrit.gromacs.org/#/c/,1,1,1,1,1,Inc

 HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();

A lot of GWT code assumes this and that is a bad thing because there are a couple of things that we can not do to optimize array because of that (e.g. putting fields on an array makes FF opt out of some optimizations).
I am thinking that we might want to model arrays as an object with a field for the array and other fields for GWT stuff (type info) and let the compiler inline all access to the array at the right places. This might make ArrayList as fast as JsArray.",https://gwt-review.googlesource.com/#/c/,0,-1,0,0,0,Ex

To expand on what Tobias said, when you change the content of a language string you also need to change its name. Otherwise the Launchpad translation site isn't smart enough to tell translators that they need to update it. See https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Developer_Area/Language_strings#Let_translators_know_when_lang_strings_change

So please change the string name to ""editaccesspagedescription4"". You'll also need to change the name of the string in the PHP files and templates where it is used.

Sorry about that!

Hm... the skins patch added the site-logo-small-white.png file to the ""raw"" theme for this specific purpose. BUT, depending on the theme used on the page, the corresponding site-logo-small.png will not necessarily have dark text. On a dark-background theme, site-logo-small.png and site-logo.png will themselves have light text.

1. site-logo.png: Used in normal page headers

2. site-logo-light.png: Used on skinned Pages with ""light text logo""

3. site-logo-dark.png: Used on skinned Pages with ""dark text logo""
